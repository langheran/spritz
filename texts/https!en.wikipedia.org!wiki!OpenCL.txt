Memory hierarchy
OpenCL defines a four-level memory hierarchy for the compute device:[12]

global memory: shared by all processing elements, but has high access latency (__global);
read-only memory: smaller, low latency, writable by the host CPU but not the compute devices (__constant);
local memory: shared by a group of processing elements (__local);
per-element private memory (registers; __private).
Not every device needs to implement each level of this hierarchy in hardware. Consistency between the various levels in the hierarchy is relaxed, and only enforced by explicit synchronization constructs, notably barriers.

Devices may or may not share memory with the host CPU.[12] The host API provides handles on device memory buffers and functions to transfer data back and forth between host and devices.
