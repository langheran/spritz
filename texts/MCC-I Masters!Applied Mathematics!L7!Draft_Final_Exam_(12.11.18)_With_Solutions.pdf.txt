I. PARAMETER ESTIMATION Exercise I.1. From past experience, it is known that the weights of salmon grown at a commercial hatchery are normal with a mean that varies from season to season but with a standard deviation that remains fixed at 0.3 pounds. If we want to be 95 percent certain that our estimate of the present season's mean weight of a salmon is correct to within ±0.1 pounds, how large a sample is needed?
Exercise I.2. Determine a 95 percent confidence interval for the average resting pulse of the members of a health club if a random selection of 15 members of the club yielded the data 54, 63, 58, 72, 49, 92, 70, 73, 69, 104, 48, 66, 80, 64, 77.
II. HYPOTHESIS TESTING Exercise II.1. All cigarettes presently on the market have an average nicotine content of at least 1.6 mg per cigarette. A firm that produces cigarettes claims that it has discovered a new way to cure tobacco leaves that will result in the average nicotine content of a cigarette being less than 1.6 mg. To test this claim, a sample of 20 of the firm's cigarettes were analyzed. If it is known that the standard deviation of a cigarette's nicotine content is .8 mg, what conclusions can be drawn, at the 5 percent level of significance, if the average nicotine content of the 20 cigarettes is 1.54?
Exercise II.2. A public health official claims that the mean home water use is 350 gallons a day. To verify this claim, a study of 20 randomly selected homes was instigated with the result that the average daily water uses of these 20 homes were as follows:
340 344 362 375 356 386 354 364 332 402 340 355 362 322 372 324 318 360 338 370 Do the data contradict the official's claim?

IV. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) Exercise IV.1. An auto rental firm is using 15 identical motors that are adjusted to run at a fixed speed to test 3 different brands of gasoline. Each brand of gasoline is assigned to exactly 5 of the motors. Each motor runs on 10 gallons of gasoline until it is out of fuel. The following represents the total mileages obtained by the different motors: Gas 1: 220 251 226 246 260 Gas 2: 244 235 232 242 225 Gas 3: 252 272 250 238 256 Test the hypothesis that the average mileage obtained is not affected by the type of gas used. Use the 5 percent level of significance.

The cost of holding an air compressor in inventory is $50/quarter. Demand may be back-logged (as long as it is met by the end of quarter 3) at a cost of $60/comp./quarter. Formulate the tableau for a balanced transportation problem whose solution tells Air Co. how to minimize the total cost of meeting the demands for quarters 1 ­ 3.

ANSWERS and SOLUTIONS

Exercise I.1. A 95 percent confidence interval estimate for the unknown mean , based on a

sample of size n, is





 

x

 1.96

 n

,x

 1.96

 n

 

.

Because the estimate x is within 0.588 of any point in the interval, it follows that we can be 95 n

percent certain that x is within 0.1 of  provided that 0.588  0.1. That is, provided that n

n  5.88 , or, n  34.57 . That is, a sample size of 35 or larger will suffice.

Exercise I.2. Here, the population variance is unknown, so we will apply the T-distribution

procedure with 14 degrees of freedom applied to the directly calculates sample mean

x  69.26667 and the sample standard deviation s  15.16795 . Next, for example, the EXCEL

function T.INV.2T(0.05,14) gives us the desired t-score equal to t0.025,14  2.144787 , which yields

the 95%-confidence interval for the population mean as x  margin , where the margin is found

as

t 0.025,14

s n



2.144787



15.16795 15



8.39973.

With this data at hand, one easily finds that the

desired two-sided interval is x  8.39973 ; in other terms, we can be 95 percent certain that

  60.86694;77.6664 .

Exercise II.1. We must first decide on the appropriate null hypothesis. As was previously noted, our approach to testing is not symmetric with respect to the null and the alternative hypotheses since we consider only tests having the property that their probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true will never exceed the significance level . Thus, whereas the rejection of the null hypothesis is a strong statement about the data not being consistent with this hypothesis, an analogous statement cannot be made when the null hypothesis is accepted. Hence, since in the preceding example we would like to endorse the producer's claims only when there is substantial evidence for it, we should take this claim as the alternative hypothesis. That is, we should test
H0 :   1.6 versus H1 :  < 1.6.
Now, the value of the test statistic is n  X  0    20 1.54 1.6 .8  .336 .
So the p-value is given by p-value = P{Z < .336}=.368, Z  N(0, 1).
5

Since this value is greater than .05, the foregoing data do not enable us to reject, at the .05 percent level of significance, the hypothesis that the mean nicotine content exceeds 1.6 mg. In other words, the evidence, although supporting the cigarette producer's claim, is not strong enough to prove that claim.

Exercise II.2. To determine if the data contradict the official's claim, we need to test

H0 :  = 350 versus H1 :   350.

This can be accomplished by running

https://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Business-

stat/otherapplets/MeanTest.htm , or, if it is inconvenient to utilize, by noting first that the sample

mean and sample standard deviation of the preceding data set are

X = 353.8, S = 21.8478.

Thus, the value of the test statistic is T 

n

X

 350 S



20

3.8 21.8478



.7778

.

Because this is less than t.05,19 = 1.730, the null hypothesis is accepted at the 10 percent level of

significance. Indeed, the p-value of the test data is

p-value = P{|T19| > .7778} = 2P{T19 > .7778} = .4462, indicating that the null hypothesis would be accepted at any reasonable significance level,

and thus that the data are not inconsistent with the claim of the health official.

Exercise III.1. By running program Simple Linear Regression on page https://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Business-stat/otherapplets/Regression.htm we find that the equation of the estimated regression line is Y = -2.51 + 0.32X.

Exercise IV.1. We run Program Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): Equality of Normal Populations on the page https://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Businessstat/otherapplets/ANOVA.htm to obtain the results shown in Figure 10.1. Since the p-value (0.1136 by EXCEL, 0.1157 by the link) is greater than .05, the null hypothesis that the mean mileage is the same for all 3 brands of gasoline cannot be rejected.

Exercise V.1. x1*  30, x*2  x3*  0; Z*  60.

Exercise V.2. See our eBook (PC edition) pp. 134 ­ 140 as to how to solve this problem with the streamlined simplex method. The initial streamlined simplex tableau is as follows:

6

Cost Per Unit Distributed | Destination | | 1 2 3 4 | Supply _________|_____________________________|_______ 1| 350 400 450 0 | 240 Source 2| 320 260 310 0 | 240 3| 310 250 190 0 | 240 __________|_____________________________|_______ Demand | 210 290 140 80 |
The optimal solution is: x1*1  160; x*21  50; x*22  190; x3*2  100; x3*3  140; Z*  $173,000. In other words, the company produces and supplies 160 comps during the first quarter, and satisfies the backlogged demand of the first quarter (50 comps) in the second quarter. During the same quarter 2, the company uses the remaining capacity to produce 190 comps to supply the consumer to (partially) satisfy her demand for this quarter. Finally, in quarter 3, the company again exploits its capacity in full grade by producing 100 comps to satisfy the consumer's backlogged demand for quarter 2, and 100 comps to cover completely the consumer quarter 3's demand of 140. The total cost although large enough ($173,000) still proves to be lower than if the company didn't use the backlogged supply option.
Exercise VI.1. See our eBook (PC edition) pp. 141 ­ 145 as to how to solve this problem with the Hungarian algorithm. The optimal solution is: x*21  1; x*43  1; x5*2  1; Z*  6  4  4  14. In words, Car 2 responds to Call 1, Car 5 responds to Call 2, and Car 4 responds to Call 3, with the total response time 14 minutes. The solution is not unique. For example, an alternative solution is: x*41  1; x5*2  1; x*33  1; Z*  5  4  5  14.
Exercise VI.2. See our eBook (PC edition) pp. 141 ­ 145 as to how to solve this problem with the Hungarian algorithm. The optimal solution is:
x*41  1; x1*2  1; x3*3  1; x*24  1; Z*  2  5  3  5  15 . In words, Machine 4 does Job 1, Machine 1 does Job 2, Machine 3 does Job 3, and Machine 2 does Job 4; the total time is 15 hours.
Exercise VII.1. See our eBook (PC edition) pp. 107 ­ 114 as to how to solve this problem with the dual (modified in the IOR Tutorial) simplex method. The optimal solution is: x1*  0; x*2  13.6; x3*  8.2; Z*  38.2.

Exercise VII.2. See our eBook (PC edition) pp. 99 ­ 106 as to how to solve this problem with the

elements of duality theory (including Complementarity Slackness Theorem). In more detail, as the

primal problem is

z  3x1  2x2  4x3  5x4  max

s.t.

x1 2x2 x3  2x4  5 2x1 3x2 x3  3x4  8

x1  0, x2 free, x3  0, x4  0. ,

then its dual is as follows:

w  5y1  8y2  min s.t.

y1 2y2  3 2y1 3y2  2 y1 y2  4 2y1 3y2  5 and

y1 free, y2  0. The graphical approach gives us the latter problem's solution:

y

* 1



10;

y

* 2



6;

w *  2.

As constraints 1 y 4 in the dual problem boast non-zero residuals at the optimal solution, hence by

Complementarity Slackness Theorem, the corresponding variables of the primal problem have

zero optimal values:

x

* 1



x

* 4



0.

Next, Complementarity Slackness Theorem assures that both constraints of the primal problem

must hold as equalities (because both optimal values of the dual variables are non-zero), which

generates the following system of 2 equations in two variables:

2x2 x3  5, 3x2  x3  8,

which yields x*2  3,x*3  1. Therefore, one has the optimal solution of the primal problem to be:

x1*

 0;

x 2*



3;

x

* 3

 1;

x

* 4

 0;
