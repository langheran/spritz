FOOD LION*
SALISBURY, NORTH CAROLINA
Founded in 1957 as Food Town, Food Lion is one of the largest supermarket chains in the United States, with 1300 stores in 11 Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. The company sells more than 24,000 different products and offers nationally and regionally advertised brand-name merchandise, as well as a growing number of high-quality private label products manufactured especially for Food Lion. The company maintains its low price leadership and quality assurance through operating efficiencies such as standard store formats, innovative warehouse design, energyefficient facilities, and data synchronization with suppliers. Food Lion looks to a future of continued innovation, growth, price leadership, and service to its customers.
Being in an inventory-intense business, Food Lion made the decision to adopt the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory valuation. This method matches current costs against current revenues, which minimizes the effect of radical price changes on profit and loss results. In addition, the LIFO method reduces net income thereby reducing income taxes during periods of inflation.
Food Lion establishes a LIFO index for each of seven inventory pools: Grocery, Paper/Household, Pet Supplies, Health & Beauty Aids, Dairy, Cigarette/Tobacco, and Beer/Wine. For example, a LIFO index of 1.008 for the Grocery pool would indicate that the company's grocery inventory value at current costs reflects a 0.8% increase due to inflation over the most recent one-year period.
A LIFO index for each inventory pool requires that the year-end inventory count for each product be valued at the current year-end cost and at the preceding year-end

cost. To avoid excessive time and expense associated with counting the inventory in all 1200 store locations, Food Lion selects a random sample of 50 stores. Yearend physical inventories are taken in each of the sample stores. The current-year and preceding-year costs for each item are then used to construct the required LIFO indexes for each inventory pool.
For a recent year, the sample estimate of the LIFO index for the Health & Beauty Aids inventory pool was 1.015. Using a 95% confidence level, Food Lion computed a margin of error of .006 for the sample estimate. Thus, the interval from 1.009 to 1.021 provided a 95% confidence interval estimate of the population LIFO index. This level of precision was judged to be very good.
In this chapter you will learn how to compute the margin of error associated with sample estimates. You will also learn how to use this information to construct and interpret interval estimates of a population mean and a population proportion.

In Chapter 7, we stated that a point estimator is a sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter. For instance, the sample mean x¯ is a point estimator of the population mean  and the sample proportion p¯ is a point estimator of the population proportion p. Because a point estimator cannot be expected to provide the exact value of the population parameter, an interval estimate is often computed by adding and subtracting a value, called the margin of error, to the point estimate. The general form of an interval estimate is as follows:
Point estimate  Margin of error

310 Chapter 8 Interval Estimation
The purpose of an interval estimate is to provide information about how close the point estimate, provided by the sample, is to the value of the population parameter.
In this chapter we show how to compute interval estimates of a population mean  and a population proportion p. The general form of an interval estimate of a population mean is
x¯  Margin of error
Similarly, the general form of an interval estimate of a population proportion is
p¯  Margin of error
The sampling distributions of x¯ and p¯ play key roles in computing these interval estimates.

Lloyd's

In order to develop an interval estimate of a population mean, either the population standard deviation  or the sample standard deviation s must be used to compute the margin of error. In most applications  is not known, and s is used to compute the margin of error. In some applications, however, large amounts of relevant historical data are available and can be used to estimate the population standard deviation prior to sampling. Also, in quality control applications where a process is assumed to be operating correctly, or "in control," it is appropriate to treat the population standard deviation as known. We refer to such cases as the  known case. In this section we introduce an example in which it is reasonable to treat  as known and show how to construct an interval estimate for this case.
Each week Lloyd's Department Store selects a simple random sample of 100 customers in order to learn about the amount spent per shopping trip. With x representing the amount spent per shopping trip, the sample mean x¯ provides a point estimate of , the mean amount spent per shopping trip for the population of all Lloyd's customers. Lloyd's has been using the weekly survey for several years. Based on the historical data, Lloyd's now assumes a known value of   $20 for the population standard deviation. The historical data also indicate that the population follows a normal distribution.
During the most recent week, Lloyd's surveyed 100 customers (n  100) and obtained a sample mean of x¯  $82. The sample mean amount spent provides a point estimate of the population mean amount spent per shopping trip, . In the discussion that follows, we show how to compute the margin of error for this estimate and develop an interval estimate of the population mean.

Margin of Error and the Interval Estimate
In Chapter 7 we showed that the sampling distribution of x¯ can be used to compute the probability that x¯ will be within a given distance of . In the Lloyd's example, the historical data show that the population of amounts spent is normally distributed with a standard deviation of   20. So, using what we learned in Chapter 7, we can conclude that the sampling distribution of x¯ follows a normal distribution with a standard error of
x¯  n  20100  2. This sampling distribution is shown in Figure 8.1.1 Because

conclude that the sampling distribution of we could rely on the central limit theorem approximately normal. In either case, the

the sampling distribution shows how values of x¯ are distributed around the population mean , the sampling distribution of x¯ provides information about the possible differences between x¯ and .
Using the standard normal probability table, we find that 95% of the values of any normally distributed random variable are within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Thus, when the sampling distribution of x¯ is normally distributed, 95% of the x¯ values must be within 1.96x¯ of the mean . In the Lloyd's example we know that the sampling distribution of x¯ is normally distributed with a standard error of x¯  2. Because 1.96x¯ 1.96(2)  3.92, we can conclude that 95% of all x¯ values obtained using a sample size of n  100 will be within 3.92 of the population mean . See Figure 8.2.

312 Chapter 8 Interval Estimation
In the introduction to this chapter we said that the general form of an interval estimate of the population mean  is x¯  margin of error. For the Lloyd's example, suppose we set the margin of error equal to 3.92 and compute the interval estimate of  using x¯  3.92. To provide an interpretation for this interval estimate, let us consider the values of x¯ that could be obtained if we took three different simple random samples, each consisting of 100 Lloyd's customers. The first sample mean might turn out to have the value shown as x¯1 in Figure 8.3. In this case, Figure 8.3 shows that the interval formed by subtracting 3.92 from x¯1 and adding 3.92 to x¯1 includes the population mean . Now consider what happens if the second sample mean turns out to have the value shown as x¯2 in Figure 8.3. Although this sample mean differs from the first sample mean, we see that the interval formed by subtracting 3.92 from x¯2 and adding 3.92 to x¯2 also includes the population mean . However, consider what happens if the third sample mean turns out to have the value shown as x¯3 in Figure 8.3. In this case, the interval formed by subtracting 3.92 from x¯3 and adding 3.92 to x¯3 does not include the population mean . Because x¯3 falls in the upper tail of the sampling distribution and is farther than 3.92 from , subtracting and adding 3.92 to x¯3 forms an interval that does not include .
Any sample mean x¯ that is within the darkly shaded region of Figure 8.3 will provide an interval that contains the population mean . Because 95% of all possible sample means are in the darkly shaded region, 95% of all intervals formed by subtracting 3.92 from x¯ and adding 3.92 to x¯ will include the population mean .
Recall that during the most recent week, the quality assurance team at Lloyd's surveyed 100 customers and obtained a sample mean amount spent of x¯  82. Using x¯  3.92 to

construct the interval estimate, we obtain 82  3.92. Thus, the specific interval estimate of  based on the data from the most recent week is 82  3.92  78.08 to 82  3.92  85.92. Because 95% of all the intervals constructed using x¯  3.92 will contain the population mean, we say that we are 95% confident that the interval 78.08 to 85.92 includes the popu-
lation mean . We say that this interval has been established at the 95% confidence level. The value .95 is referred to as the confidence coefficient, and the interval 78.08 to 85.92 is
called the 95% confidence interval.
With the margin of error given by z/2(n ), the general form of an interval estimate of a population mean for the  known case follows.

where (1  ) is the confidence coefficient and z/2 is the z value providing an area of /2 in the upper tail of the standard normal probability distribution.

Let us use expression (8.1) to construct a 95% confidence interval for the Lloyd's ex-
ample. For a 95% confidence interval, the confidence coefficient is (1  )  .95 and thus,   .05. Using the standard normal probability table, an area of /2  .05/2  .025 in the upper tail provides z.025  1.96. With the Lloyd's sample mean x¯  82,   20, and a sample size n  100, we obtain

82  3.92

Thus, using expression (8.1), the margin of error is 3.92 and the 95% confidence interval is 82  3.92  78.08 to 82  3.92  85.92.
Although a 95% confidence level is frequently used, other confidence levels such as 90% and 99% may be considered. Values of z/2 for the most commonly used confidence levels are shown in Table 8.1. Using these values and expression (8.1), the 90% confidence interval for the Lloyd's example is

314 Chapter 8 Interval Estimation
Thus, at 90% confidence, the margin of error is 3.29 and the confidence interval is 82  3.29  78.71 to 82  3.29  85.29. Similarly, the 99% confidence interval is
82  2.576 20
100
82  5.15
Thus, at 99% confidence, the margin of error is 5.15 and the confidence interval is 82  5.15  76.85 to 82  5.15  87.15.
Comparing the results for the 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels, we see that in order to have a higher degree of confidence, the margin of error and thus the width of the confidence interval must be larger.
Practical Advice
If the population follows a normal distribution, the confidence interval provided by expression (8.1) is exact. In other words, if expression (8.1) were used repeatedly to generate 95% confidence intervals, exactly 95% of the intervals generated would contain the population mean. If the population does not follow a normal distribution, the confidence interval provided by expression (8.1) will be approximate. In this case, the quality of the approximation depends on both the distribution of the population and the sample size.
In most applications, a sample size of n  30 is adequate when using expression (8.1) to develop an interval estimate of a population mean. If the population is not normally distributed, but is roughly symmetric, sample sizes as small as 15 can be expected to provide good approximate confidence intervals. With smaller sample sizes, expression (8.1) should only be used if the analyst believes, or is willing to assume, that the population distribution is at least approximately normal.

NOTES AND COMMENTS

1. The interval estimation procedure discussed in this section is based on the assumption that the population standard deviation  is known. By  known we mean that historical data or other information are available that permit us to obtain a good estimate of the population standard deviation prior to taking the sample that will be used to develop an estimate of the population mean. So technically we don't mean that  is actually known with certainty. We just mean that we obtained a good estimate of the standard deviation prior to sampling and thus we won't be using the

same sample to estimate both the population mean and the population standard deviation. 2. The sample size n appears in the denominator of the interval estimation expression (8.1). Thus, if a particular sample size provides too wide an interval to be of any practical use, we may want to consider increasing the sample size. With n in the denominator, a larger sample size will provide a smaller margin of error, a narrower interval, and greater precision. The procedure for determining the size of a simple random sample necessary to obtain a desired precision is discussed in Section 8.3.

8.2 Population Mean:  Unknown

William Sealy Gosset, writing under the name "Student," is the founder of the t distribution. Gosset, an Oxford graduate in mathematics, worked for the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Ireland. He developed the t distribution while working on smallscale materials and temperature experiments.

When developing an interval estimate of a population mean we usually do not have a good estimate of the population standard deviation either. In these cases, we must use the same sample to estimate both  and . This situation represents the  unknown case. When s is used to estimate , the margin of error and the interval estimate for the population mean are based on a probability distribution known as the t distribution. Although the mathematical development of the t distribution is based on the assumption of a normal distribution for the population we are sampling from, research shows that the t distribution can be successfully applied in many situations where the population deviates significantly from normal. Later in this section we provide guidelines for using the t distribution if the population is not normally distributed.
The t distribution is a family of similar probability distributions, with a specific t distribution depending on a parameter known as the degrees of freedom. The t distribution with one degree of freedom is unique, as is the t distribution with two degrees of freedom, with three degrees of freedom, and so on. As the number of degrees of freedom increases, the difference between the t distribution and the standard normal distribution becomes smaller and smaller. Figure 8.4 shows t distributions with 10 and 20 degrees of freedom and their relationship to the standard normal probability distribution. Note that a t distribution with more degrees of freedom exhibits less variability and more

As the degrees of freedom increase, the t distribution approaches the standard normal distribution.

closely resembles the standard normal distribution. Note also that the mean of the t distribution is zero.
We place a subscript on t to indicate the area in the upper tail of the t distribution. For example, just as we used z.025 to indicate the z value providing a .025 area in the upper tail of a standard normal distribution, we will use t.025 to indicate a .025 area in the upper tail of a t distribution. In general, we will use the notation t/2 to represent a t value with an area of /2 in the upper tail of the t distribution. See Figure 8.5.
Table 2 in Appendix B contains a table for the t distribution. A portion of this table is shown in Table 8.2. Each row in the table corresponds to a separate t distribution with the degrees of freedom shown. For example, for a t distribution with 9 degrees of freedom, t.025  2.262. Similarly, for a t distribution with 60 degrees of freedom, t.025  2.000. As the degrees of freedom continue to increase, t.025 approaches z.025  1.96. In fact, the standard normal distribution z values can be found in the infinite degrees of freedom row (labeled ) of the t distribution table. If the degrees of freedom exceed 100, the infinite degrees of freedom row can be used to approximate the actual t value; in other words, for more than 100 degrees of freedom, the standard normal z value provides a good approximation to the t value.

where s is the sample standard deviation, (1  ) is the confidence coefficient, and t/2 is the t value providing an area of /2 in the upper tail of the t distribution with n  1 degrees of freedom.

The reason the number of degrees of freedom associated with the t value in expression
(8.2) is n  1 concerns the use of s as an estimate of the population standard deviation . The expression for the sample standard deviation is

s 

(xi  x¯)2 n1

Degrees of freedom refer to the number of independent pieces of information that go into the

computation of (xi  x¯)2. The n pieces of information involved in computing (xi  x¯)2 are as follows: x1  x¯, x2  x¯, . . . , xn  x¯. In Section 3.2 we indicated that (xi  x¯)  0 for any data set. Thus, only n  1 of the xi  x¯ values are independent; that is, if we know n  1 of the values, the remaining value can be determined exactly by using the condition that the

sum of the ciated with

xi  (xi

x¯ values must be  x¯)2 and hence

0. Thus, n  1 the number of

A sample of n  70 households provided the credit card balances shown in Table 8.3. For

this situation, no previous estimate of the population standard deviation  is available. Thus,

the sample data must be used to estimate both the population mean and the population stan-

dard deviation. Using the data in Table 8.3, we compute the sample mean x¯  $9312 and the

sample standard deviation s  $4007. With 95% confidence and n  1  69 degrees of

We use expression (8.2) to compute an interval estimate of the population mean credit card balance.

The point estimate of the population mean is $9312, the margin of error is $955, and the 95% confidence interval is 9312  955  $8357 to 9312  955  $10,267. Thus, we are 95% confident that the mean credit card balance for the population of all households is between $8357 and $10,267.
The procedures used by Minitab, Excel and StatTools to develop confidence intervals for a population mean are described in Appendixes 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. For the household credit card balances study, the results of the Minitab interval estimation procedure are shown in Figure 8.6. The sample of 70 households provides a sample mean credit card balance of $9312, a sample standard deviation of $4007, a standard error of the mean of $479, and a 95% confidence interval of $8357 to $10,267.

Larger sample sizes are needed if the distribution of the population is highly skewed or includes outliers.

Practical Advice
If the population follows a normal distribution, the confidence interval provided by expression (8.2) is exact and can be used for any sample size. If the population does not follow a normal distribution, the confidence interval provided by expression (8.2) will be approximate. In this case, the quality of the approximation depends on both the distribution of the population and the sample size.
In most applications, a sample size of n  30 is adequate when using expression (8.2) to develop an interval estimate of a population mean. However, if the population distribution is highly skewed or contains outliers, most statisticians would recommend increasing the sample size to 50 or more. If the population is not normally distributed but is roughly symmetric, sample sizes as small as 15 can be expected to provide good approximate confidence intervals. With smaller sample sizes, expression (8.2) should only be used if the analyst believes, or is willing to assume, that the population distribution is at least approximately normal.

Using a Small Sample
In the following example we develop an interval estimate for a population mean when the sample size is small. As we already noted, an understanding of the distribution of the population becomes a factor in deciding whether the interval estimation procedure provides acceptable results.

A sample of 20 employees is selected, with each employee in the sample completing the training program. Data on the training time in days for the 20 employees are shown in Table 8.4. A histogram of the sample data appears in Figure 8.7. What can we say about the distribution of the population based on this histogram? First, the sample data do not support the conclusion that the distribution of the population is normal, yet we do not see any evidence of skewness or outliers. Therefore, using the guidelines in the previous subsection, we conclude that an interval estimate based on the t distribution appears acceptable for the sample of 20 employees.

Using a histogram of the sample data to learn about the distribution of a population is not always conclusive, but in many cases it provides the only information available. The histogram, along with judgment on the part of the analyst, can often be used to decide whether expression (8.2) can be used to develop the interval estimate.
Summary of Interval Estimation Procedures
We provided two approaches to developing an interval estimate of a population mean. For the  known case,  and the standard normal distribution are used in expression (8.1) to compute the margin of error and to develop the interval estimate. For the  unknown case, the sample standard deviation s and the t distribution are used in expression (8.2) to compute the margin of error and to develop the interval estimate.
A summary of the interval estimation procedures for the two cases is shown in Figure 8.8. In most applications, a sample size of n  30 is adequate. If the population has a normal or approximately normal distribution, however, smaller sample sizes may be used.

bution to the right. When such skewness ex-

ists, the sample mean x¯ and the sample

standard deviation s are positively corre-

lated. Larger values of s tend to be associated

with larger values of x¯. Thus, when x¯ is larger

than the population mean, s tends to be larger

than . This skewness causes the margin of

is smaller than the population mean, the cor-

relation between x¯ and s causes the margin of

error to be small. In this case, the confidence

interval with the smaller margin of error

tends to miss the population mean more than

it would if we knew  and used it. For

this reason, we recommend using larger sam-

8.3 Determining the Sample Size

If a desired margin of error is selected prior to sampling, the procedures in this section can be used to determine the sample size necessary to satisfy the margin of error requirement.

In providing practical advice in the two preceding sections, we commented on the role of the sample size in providing good approximate confidence intervals when the population is not normally distributed. In this section, we focus on another aspect of the sample size issue. We describe how to choose a sample size large enough to provide a desired margin of error. To understand how this process works, we return to the  known case presented in Section 8.1. Using expression (8.1), the interval estimate is

x¯



z/2

 n

326 Chapter 8 Interval Estimation

The quantity z/2(n) is the margin of error. Thus, we see that z/2, the population standard deviation , and the sample size n combine to determine the margin of error. Once we select a confidence coefficient 1  , z/2 can be determined. Then, if we have a value for , we can determine the sample size n needed to provide any desired margin of error. Development of the formula used to compute the required sample size n follows.
Let E  the desired margin of error:

Solving for n, we have

E



z/2

 n

n  z/2 E

Squaring both sides of this equation, we obtain the following expression for the sample size.

Equation (8.3) can be used to provide a good sample size recommendation. However, judgment on the part of the analyst should be used to determine whether the final sample size should be adjusted upward.
A planning value for the population standard deviation  must be specified before the sample size can be determined. Three methods of obtaining a planning value for  are discussed here.

SAMPLE SIZE FOR AN INTERVAL ESTIMATE OF A POPULATION MEAN

n



(z/2)2 2 E2

(8.3)

This sample size provides the desired margin of error at the chosen confidence level. In equation (8.3), E is the margin of error that the user is willing to accept, and the value
of z/2 follows directly from the confidence level to be used in developing the interval estimate. Although user preference must be considered, 95% confidence is the most frequently chosen value (z.025  1.96).
Finally, use of equation (8.3) requires a value for the population standard deviation . However, even if  is unknown, we can use equation (8.3) provided we have a preliminary or planning value for . In practice, one of the following procedures can be chosen.
1. Use the estimate of the population standard deviation computed from data of previous studies as the planning value for .
2. Use a pilot study to select a preliminary sample. The sample standard deviation from the preliminary sample can be used as the planning value for .
3. Use judgment or a "best guess" for the value of . For example, we might begin by estimating the largest and smallest data values in the population. The difference between the largest and smallest values provides an estimate of the range for the data. Finally, the range divided by 4 is often suggested as a rough approximation of the standard deviation and thus an acceptable planning value for .
Let us demonstrate the use of equation (8.3) to determine the sample size by considering the following example. A previous study that investigated the cost of renting automobiles in the United States found a mean cost of approximately $55 per day for renting a midsize automobile. Suppose that the organization that conducted this study would like to conduct a new study in order to estimate the population mean daily rental cost for a midsize automobile in the United States. In designing the new study, the project director specifies that the population mean daily rental cost be estimated with a margin of error of $2 and a 95% level of confidence.
The project director specified a desired margin of error of E  2, and the 95% level of confidence indicates z.025  1.96. Thus, we only need a planning value for the population standard deviation  in order to compute the required sample size. At this point, an analyst reviewed the sample data from the previous study and found that the sample standard deviation for the daily rental cost was $9.65. Using 9.65 as the planning value for , we obtain

8.3 Determining the Sample Size

327

Equation (8.3) provides the minimum sample size needed to satisfy the desired margin of error requirement. If the computed sample size is not an integer, rounding up to the next integer value will provide a margin of error slightly smaller than required.

n



(z/2 )2 2 E2



(1.96)2(9.65)2 22



89.43

Thus, the sample size for the new study needs to be at least 89.43 midsize automobile rentals in order to satisfy the project director's $2 margin-of-error requirement. In cases where the computed n is not an integer, we round up to the next integer value; hence, the recommended sample size is 90 midsize automobile rentals.

of the sampling distribution of p¯. The mean of the sampling distribution of p¯ is the population proportion p, and the standard error of p¯ is

p(1  p)

p¯ 

n

(8.4)

Because the sampling distribution of p¯ is normally distributed, if we choose z/2p¯ as the margin of error in an interval estimate of a population proportion, we know that 100(1  )% of the intervals generated will contain the true population proportion. But p¯ cannot be used directly in the computation of the margin of error because p will not be known; p is what we are trying to estimate. So p¯ is substituted for p and the margin of error for an interval estimate of a population proportion is given by

Margin of error  z/2

p¯ (1  p¯) n

(8.5)

With this margin of error, the general expression for an interval estimate of a population proportion is as follows.

TeeTimes

The following example illustrates the computation of the margin of error and interval estimate for a population proportion. A national survey of 900 women golfers was conducted to learn how women golfers view their treatment at golf courses in the United States. The survey found that 396 of the women golfers were satisfied with the availability of tee times. Thus, the point estimate of the proportion of the population of women golfers who are satisfied with the availability of tee times is 396/900  .44. Using expression (8.6) and a 95% confidence level,

p¯  z/2

p¯(1  p¯) n

.44  1.96

.44(1  .44) 900

.44  .0324

Thus, the margin of error is .0324 and the 95% confidence interval estimate of the population proportion is .4076 to .4724. Using percentages, the survey results enable us to state with 95% confidence that between 40.76% and 47.24% of all women golfers are satisfied with the availability of tee times.

330 Chapter 8 Interval Estimation

Determining the Sample Size

Let us consider the question of how large the sample size should be to obtain an estimate of a population proportion at a specified level of precision. The rationale for the sample size determination in developing interval estimates of p is similar to the rationale used in Section 8.3 to determine the sample size for estimating a population mean.
Previously in this section we said that the margin of error associated with an interval
estimate of a population proportion is z/2p¯ (1  p¯)n. The margin of error is based on the
value of z/2, the sample proportion p¯, and the sample size n. Larger sample sizes provide a smaller margin of error and better precision.
Let E denote the desired margin of error.

E  z/2

p¯(1  p¯) n

Solving this equation for n provides a formula for the sample size that will provide a margin of error of size E.

n



(z/2 )2p¯(1 E2



p¯)

Note, however, that we cannot use this formula to compute the sample size that will provide the desired margin of error because p¯ will not be known until after we select the sample. What we need, then, is a planning value for p¯ that can be used to make the computation. Using p* to denote the planning value for p¯, the following formula can be used to compute the sample size that will provide a margin of error of size E.

SAMPLE SIZE FOR AN INTERVAL ESTIMATE OF A POPULATION PROPORTION

n



(z/2 )2p*(1 E2

(8.7)

In practice, the planning value p* can be chosen by one of the following procedures.
1. Use the sample proportion from a previous sample of the same or similar units. 2. Use a pilot study to select a preliminary sample. The sample proportion from this
sample can be used as the planning value, p*. 3. Use judgment or a "best guess" for the value of p*. 4. If none of the preceding alternatives apply, use a planning value of p*  .50.
Let us return to the survey of women golfers and assume that the company is interested in conducting a new survey to estimate the current proportion of the population of women golfers who are satisfied with the availability of tee times. How large should the sample be if the survey director wants to estimate the population proportion with a margin of error of .025 at 95% confidence? With E  .025 and z/2  1.96, we need a planning value p* to answer the sample size question. Using the previous survey result of p¯  .44 as the planning value p*, equation (8.7) shows that

n



(z/2 )2p*(1 E2

Thus, the sample size must be at least 1514.5 women golfers to satisfy the margin of error
requirement. Rounding up to the next integer value indicates that a sample of 1515 women
golfers is recommended to satisfy the margin of error requirement.
The fourth alternative suggested for selecting a planning value p* is to use p*  .50.This value of p* is frequently used when no other information is available. To understand why, note that the
numerator of equation (8.7) shows that the sample size is proportional to the quantity p*(1  p*). A larger value for the quantity p*(1  p*) will result in a larger sample size. Table 8.5 gives some possible values of p*(1  p*). Note that the largest value of p*(1  p*) occurs when p*  .50. Thus, in case of any uncertainty about an appropriate planning value, we know that p*  .50 will provide the largest sample size recommendation. In effect, we play it safe by recommending the
largest necessary sample size. If the sample proportion turns out to be different from the .50 plan-
ning value, the margin of error will be smaller than anticipated. Thus, in using p*  .50, we guarantee that the sample size will be sufficient to obtain the desired margin of error.
In the survey of women golfers example, a planning value of p*  .50 would have provided the sample size

(z/2 )2p*(1 E2



p*)



(1.96)2(.50)(1  (.025)2

.50)



1536.6

Thus, a slightly larger sample size of 1537 women golfers would be recommended.

NOTES AND COMMENTS

The desired margin of error for estimating a population proportion is almost always .10 or less. In national public opinion polls conducted by organizations such as Gallup and Harris, a .03 or .04 margin of error is common. With such margins of error,

equation (8.7) will almost always provide a sample
size that is large enough to satisfy the requirements
of np  5 and n(1  p)  5 for using a normal distribution as an approximation for the sampling
distribution of x¯.

Summary
In this chapter we presented methods for developing interval estimates of a population mean and a population proportion. A point estimator may or may not provide a good estimate of a population parameter. The use of an interval estimate provides a measure of the precision of an estimate. Both the interval estimate of the population mean and the population proportion are of the form: point estimate  margin of error.

334 Chapter 8 Interval Estimation
We presented interval estimates for a population mean for two cases. In the  known case, historical data or other information is used to develop an estimate of  prior to taking a sample. Analysis of new sample data then proceeds based on the assumption that  is known. In the  unknown case, the sample data are used to estimate both the population mean and the population standard deviation. The final choice of which interval estimation procedure to use depends upon the analyst's understanding of which method provides the best estimate of .
In the  known case, the interval estimation procedure is based on the assumed value of  and the use of the standard normal distribution. In the  unknown case, the interval estimation procedure uses the sample standard deviation s and the t distribution. In both cases the quality of the interval estimates obtained depends on the distribution of the population and the sample size. If the population is normally distributed the interval estimates will be exact in both cases, even for small sample sizes. If the population is not normally distributed, the interval estimates obtained will be approximate. Larger sample sizes will provide better approximations, but the more highly skewed the population is, the larger the sample size needs to be to obtain a good approximation. Practical advice about the sample size necessary to obtain good approximations was included in Sections 8.1 and 8.2. In most cases a sample of size 30 or more will provide good approximate confidence intervals.
The general form of the interval estimate for a population proportion is p¯  margin of error. In practice the sample sizes used for interval estimates of a population proportion are generally large. Thus, the interval estimation procedure is based on the standard normal distribution.
Often a desired margin of error is specified prior to developing a sampling plan. We showed how to choose a sample size large enough to provide the desired precision.
Glossary
Interval estimate An estimate of a population parameter that provides an interval believed to contain the value of the parameter. For the interval estimates in this chapter, it has the form: point estimate  margin of error. Margin of error The  value added to and subtracted from a point estimate in order to develop an interval estimate of a population parameter.  known The case when historical data or other information provides a good value for the population standard deviation prior to taking a sample. The interval estimation procedure uses this known value of  in computing the margin of error. Confidence level The confidence associated with an interval estimate. For example, if an interval estimation procedure provides intervals such that 95% of the intervals formed using the procedure will include the population parameter, the interval estimate is said to be constructed at the 95% confidence level. Confidence coefficient The confidence level expressed as a decimal value. For example, .95 is the confidence coefficient for a 95% confidence level. Confidence interval Another name for an interval estimate.  unknown The more common case when no good basis exists for estimating the population standard deviation prior to taking the sample. The interval estimation procedure uses the sample standard deviation s in computing the margin of error. t distribution A family of probability distributions that can be used to develop an interval estimate of a population mean whenever the population standard deviation  is unknown and is estimated by the sample standard deviation s. Degrees of freedom A parameter of the t distribution. When the t distribution is used in the computation of an interval estimate of a population mean, the appropriate t distribution has n  1 degrees of freedom, where n is the size of the simple random sample.

Professional

Young Professional magazine was developed for a target audience of recent college graduates who are in their first 10 years in a business/professional career. In its two years of publication, the magazine has been fairly successful. Now the publisher is interested in expanding the magazine's advertising base. Potential advertisers continually ask about the demographics and interests of subscribers to Young Professional.

Case Problem 2 Gulf Real Estate Properties
Gulf Real Estate Properties, Inc., is a real estate firm located in southwest Florida. The company, which advertises itself as "expert in the real estate market," monitors condominium sales by collecting data on location, list price, sale price, and number of days it takes to sell each unit. Each condominium is classified as Gulf View if it is located directly on the Gulf of Mexico or No Gulf View if it is located on the bay or a golf course, near but not on the Gulf. Sample data from the Multiple Listing Service in Naples, Florida, provided recent sales data for 40 Gulf View condominiums and 18 No Gulf View condominiums.* Prices are in thousands of dollars. The data are shown in Table 8.7.
Managerial Report
1. Use appropriate descriptive statistics to summarize each of the three variables for the 40 Gulf View condominiums.
2. Use appropriate descriptive statistics to summarize each of the three variables for the 18 No Gulf View condominiums.
3. Compare your summary results. Discuss any specific statistical results that would help a real estate agent understand the condominium market.
*Data based on condominium sales reported in the Naples MLS (Coldwell Banker, June 2000).

Auto

Metropolitan Research, Inc., a consumer research organization, conducts surveys designed to evaluate a wide variety of products and services available to consumers. In one particular study, Metropolitan looked at consumer satisfaction with the performance of automobiles produced by a major Detroit manufacturer. A questionnaire sent to owners of one of the manufacturer's full-sized cars revealed several complaints about early transmission problems. To learn more about the transmission failures, Metropolitan used a sample of actual transmission repairs provided by a transmission repair firm in the Detroit area. The following data show the actual number of miles driven for 50 vehicles at the time of transmission failure.

Managerial Report
1. Use appropriate descriptive statistics to summarize the transmission failure data. 2. Develop a 95% confidence interval for the mean number of miles driven until trans-
mission failure for the population of automobiles with transmission failure. Provide a managerial interpretation of the interval estimate. 3. Discuss the implication of your statistical findings in terms of the belief that some owners of the automobiles experienced early transmission failures. 4. How many repair records should be sampled if the research firm wants the population mean number of miles driven until transmission failure to be estimated with a margin of error of 5000 miles? Use 95% confidence. 5. What other information would you like to gather to evaluate the transmission failure problem more fully?

Individual responses are recorded as Yes if the golfer is satisfied with the availability of tee times and No otherwise. The following steps can be used to compute a 95% confidence interval estimate of the proportion of women golfers who are satisfied with the availability of tee times.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics Step 3. Choose 1 Proportion Step 4. When the 1 Proportion dialog box appears:

The Minitab default is a 95% confidence level. In order to specify a different confidence level such as 90%, enter 90 in the Confidence Level box when the 1 Proportion-Options dialog box appears in step 6.
Note: Minitab's 1 Proportion routine uses an alphabetical ordering of the responses and selects the second response for the population proportion of interest. In the women golfers example, Minitab used the alphabetical ordering No-Yes and then provided the confidence interval for the proportion of Yes responses. Because Yes was the response of interest, the Minitab output was fine. However, if Minitab's alphabetical ordering does not provide the response of interest, select any cell in the column and use the sequence: Editor  Column  Value Order. It will provide you with the option of entering a user-specified order, but you must list the response of interest second in the define-an-order box.

We illustrate interval estimation using the survey data for women golfers presented in Section 8.4. The data are in column A of an Excel worksheet. Individual responses are recorded as Yes if the golfer is satisfied with the availability of tee times and No otherwise. Excel does not offer a built-in routine to handle the estimation of a population proportion; however, it is relatively easy to develop an Excel template that can be used for this purpose. The template shown in Figure 8.11 provides the 95% confidence interval estimate of the proportion of women golfers who are satisfied with the availability of tee times. Note that the

background worksheet in Figure 8.11 shows the cell formulas that provide the interval estimation results shown in the foreground worksheet. The following steps are necessary to use the template for this data set.
Step 1. Enter the data range A2:A901 into the COUNTA cell formula in cell D3 Step 2. Enter Yes as the response of interest in cell D4 Step 3. Enter the data range A2:A901 into the COUNTIF cell formula in cell D5 Step 4. Enter .95 as the confidence coefficient in cell D8
The template automatically provides the confidence interval in cells D15 and D16. This template can be used to compute the confidence interval for a population propor-
tion for other applications. For instance, to compute the interval estimate for a new data set, enter the new sample data into column A of the worksheet and then make the changes to the four cells as shown. If the new sample data have already been summarized, the sample data do not have to be entered into the worksheet. In this case, enter the sample size into cell D3 and the sample proportion into cell D6; the worksheet template will then provide the confidence interval for the population proportion. The worksheet in Figure 8.11 is available in the file Interval p on the website that accompanies this book.

The project director specified that the population mean daily rental cost be estimated with a margin of error of $2 and a 95% level of confidence. Sample data from a previous study provided a sample standard deviation of $9.65; this value was used as the planning value for the population standard deviation. The following steps can be used to compute the recommended sample size required to provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean with a margin of error of $2.
Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon Step 2. In the Analyses group, click Statistical Inference Step 3. Choose the Sample Size Selection option Step 4. When the StatTools--Sample Size Selection dialog box appears:
