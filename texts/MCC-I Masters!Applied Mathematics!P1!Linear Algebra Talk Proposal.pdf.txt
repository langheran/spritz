Linear Algebra Talk Proposal
Chapter 9. Functions of Matrices CS4014 Applied Mathematics
Tuesday 4 September 2018
Professor: Viacheslav Kalashnikov
Team Members: Nisim Jonatan Hurst Tarrab, A01012491 , Cody Eduardo Evans Trejo, A01207043 , Víctor Manuel Arteaga Sandoval, A01372905
Purpose and justification
The purpose of this activity is to familiarize students with the concepts of matrix computations presented by Gene H. Golub's et al. book Matrix Computations [1]. The students are required to grasp Chapter 9's subject matters until they are able to present them in front of the rest of the class.
High-level description
Prepare a presentation and give a talk based on Chapter 9 of Golub's book. The chapter consist of the following subjects:
· Eigenvalue Methods ­ A Jordan-Based Definition ­ The Taylor Series Representation ­ An Eigenvector Approach ­ A Schur Decomposition Approach ­ Sensitivity of Matrix Functions
· Approximation Methods ­ A Jordan Analysis ­ A Schur Analysis ­ Taylor Approximants ­ Evaluating Matrix Polynomials ­ Computing Powers of a Matrix ­ Integrating Matrix Functions ­ A Note on the Cauchy Integral Formulation
· The Matrix Exponential ­ A Pade Approximation Method ­ Perturbation Theory ­ Pseudospectra ­ Some Stability Issues
· The Sign, Square Root, and Log of a Matrix ­ The Matrix Sign Function ­ The Matrix Square Root ­ The Polar Decomposition ­ The Matrix Logarithm
There are about 20 different methods in total. Given the 20 minutes limit it is expected to just cover the essence and importance of the four main topics, i.e Eigenvalue Methods, Approximation Methods, The Matrix Exponential and The Sign, Square Root, and Log of a Matrix.
