Homework 3.2 [1]

Exercise 3.2.1.

In an effort to estimate the mean amount spent per customer for dinner at a major Atlanta restaurant, data were collected for a sample of 49 customers. Assume a population standard deviation of $5.
a. At 95% confidence, what is the margin of error?

Margin of error = z/2 · x¯

= z/2 ·

 n

= 1.96 · 5 49

= 1.96 · 0.7143

= 1.4

b. If the sample mean is $24.80, what is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean?
Confidence Interval = x¯ ± (Margin of error) = 24.8 ± 1.4 = [23.4, 26.2]

Exercise 3.2.2.

The Wall Street Journal reported that automobile crashes cost the United States $162 billion annually (The Wall Street Journal, March 5, 2008). The average cost per person for crashes in the Tampa, Florida, area was reported to be $1,599. Suppose this average cost was based on a sample of 50 persons who had been involved in car crashes and that the population standard deviation is  = $600.
a. What is the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval?

Margin of error = z/2 · x¯

= z/2 ·

 n

= 1.96 · 600 50

= 1.96 · 84.8528

= 166.311

b. What would you recommend if the study required a margin of error of $150 or less? Yes,

Exercise 3.2.3.
The National Quality Research Center at the University of Michigan provides a quarterly measure of consumer opinions about products and services (The Wall Street Journal, February 18, 2003). A survey of 10 restaurants in the Fast Food/Pizza group showed a sample mean customer satisfaction index of 71. Past data indicate that the population standard deviation of the index has been relatively stable with  = 5 .
a. What assumption should the researcher be willing to make if a margin of error is desired? b. Using 95% confidence, what is the margin of error? c. What is the margin of error if 99% confidence is desired?
Exercise 3.2.4.
Playbill magazine reported that the mean annual household income of its readers is $119,155 (Playbill, January 2006). Assume this estimate of the mean annual household income is based on a sample of 80 households, and based on past studies, the population standard deviation is known to be  = $30, 000 .
a. Develop a 90% confidence interval estimate of the population mean. b. Develop a 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean. c. Develop a 99% confidence interval estimate of the population mean. d. Discuss what happens to the width of the confidence interval as the confidence level is increased. Does
this result seem reasonable?Explain.
Homework 3.3
Exercise 3.3.1.
Sales personnel for Skillings Distributors submit weekly reports listing the customer contacts made during the week.
a. A sample of 65 weekly reports showed a sample mean of 19.5 customer contacts per week. The sample standard deviationwas 5.2.
b. Provide 90% and 95% confidence intervals for the population mean number of weekly customer contacts for the sales personnel.
Exercise 3.3.2.
The mean number of hours of flying time for pilots at Continental Airlines is 49 hours per month (The Wall Street Journal, February 25, 2003). Assume that this mean was based on actual flying times for a sample of 100 Continental pilots and that the sample standarddeviation was 8.5 hours.
a. At 95% confidence, what is the margin of error? b. What is the 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean flying time for the pilots? c. The mean number of hours of flying time for pilots at United Airlines is 36 hours per month. Use your
results from part (b) to discuss differences between the flying times for the pilots at the two airlines. (The Wall Street Journal reported United Airlines as having the highest labor cost among all airlines. Does the information in this exercise provide insight as to why United Airlines might expect higher labor costs?)
Exercise 3.3.3.
The average cost per night of a hotel room in New York City is $273 (Smart Money, March 2009). Assume this estimate is based on a sample of 45 hotels and that the sample standard deviation is $65.
2

a. With 95% confidence, what is the margin of error? b. What is the 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean? c. Two years ago the average cost of a hotel room in New York City was $229. Discuss the change in cost
over the two-year period.

Exercise 3.3.4.
Is your favorite TV program often interrupted by advertising? CNBC presented statistics on the average number of programming minutes in a half-hour sitcom (CNBC, February 23, 2006). The following data (in minutes) are representative of their findings:

20.02 22.37 23.82 23.36

22.2 22.19 20.3 23.44

21.2 22.34 21.52

21.06 21.66 21.52

22.24 21.23 21.91

20.62 23.86 23.1

Assume the population is approximately normal. Provide a point estimate and a 95% confidence interval for the mean number of programming minutes during a half-hour television sitcom.
