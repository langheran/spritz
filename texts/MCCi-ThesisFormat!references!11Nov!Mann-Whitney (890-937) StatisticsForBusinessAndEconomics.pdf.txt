WEST SHELL REALTORS*
CINCINNATI, OHIO
West Shell Realtors was founded in 1958 with one office and a sales staff of three people. In 1964, the company began a long-term expansion program, with new offices added almost yearly. Over the years, West Shell grew to become one of the largest realtors in Greater Cincinnati, with offices in southwest Ohio, southeast Indiana, and northern Kentucky.
Statistical analysis helps real estate firms such as West Shell monitor sales performance. Monthly reports are generated for each of West Shell's offices as well as for the total company. Statistical summaries of total sales dollars, number of units sold, and median selling price per unit are essential in keeping both office managers and the company's top management informed of progress and trouble spots in the organization.
In addition to monthly summaries of ongoing operations, the company uses statistical considerations to guide corporate plans and strategies. West Shell has implemented a strategy of planned expansion. Each time an expansion plan calls for the establishment of a new sales office, the company must address the question of office location. Selling prices of homes, turnover rates, and forecast sales volumes are the types of data used in evaluating and comparing alternative locations.
In one instance, West Shell identified two suburbs, Clifton and Roselawn, as prime candidates for a new office. A variety of factors were considered in comparing the two areas, including selling prices of homes. West Shell

employed nonparametric statistical methods to help identify any differences in sales patterns for the two areas.
Samples of 25 sales in the Clifton area and 18 sales in the Roselawn area were taken, and the Mann-WhitneyWilcoxon rank-sum test was chosen as an appropriate statistical test of the difference in the pattern of selling prices.At the .05 level of significance, the Mann-WhitneyWilcoxon test did not allow rejection of the null hypothesis that the two populations of selling prices were identical. Thus, West Shell was able to focus on criteria other than selling prices of homes in the site selection process.
In this chapter we will show how nonparametric statistical tests such as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test are applied. We will also discuss the proper interpretation of such tests.

The statistical methods for inference presented previously in the text are generally known as parametric methods. These methods begin with an assumption about the probability distribution of the population which is often that the population has a normal distribution. Based upon this assumption, statisticians are able to derive the sampling distribution that can be used to make inferences about one or more parameters of the population, such as the population mean  or the population standard deviation . For example, in Chapter 9 we presented a method for making an inference about a population mean that was based on an assumption that the population had a normal probability distribution with unknown parameters  and . Using the sample standard deviation s to estimate the population

standard deviation , the test statistic for making an inference about the population mean was shown to have a t distribution. As a result, the t distribution was used to compute confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests about the mean of a normally distributed population.
In this chapter we present nonparametric methods which can be used to make inferences about a population without requiring an assumption about the specific form of the population's probability distribution. For this reason, these nonparametric methods are also called distribution-free methods.
Most of the statistical methods referred to as parametric methods require quantitative data, while nonparametric methods allow inferences based on either categorical or quantitative data. However, the computations used in the nonparametric methods are generally done with categorical data. Whenever the data are quantitative, we will transform the data into categorical data in order to conduct the nonparametric test. In the first section of the chapter, we show how the binomial distribution uses two categories of data to make an inference about a population median. In the next three sections, we show how rank-ordered data are used in nonparametric tests about two or more populations. In the final section, we use rank-ordered data to compute the rank correlation for two variables.

19.1 Sign Test
The sign test is a versatile nonparametric method for hypothesis testing that uses the binomial distribution with p  .50 as the sampling distribution. It does not require an assumption about the distribution of the population. In this section we present two applications of the sign test: one involving a hypothesis test about a population median and one involving a matched-sample test about the difference between two populations.
Hypothesis Test About a Population Median
In Chapter 9, we described how to conduct hypothesis tests about a population mean. In this section, we show how the sign test can be used to conduct a hypothesis test about a population median. If we consider a population where no data value is exactly equal to the median, the median is the measure of central tendency that divides the population so that 50% of the values are greater than the median and 50% of the values are less than the median. Whenever a population distribution is skewed, the median is often preferred over the mean as the best measure of central location for the population. The sign test provides a nonparametric procedure for testing a hypothesis about the value of a population median.
In order to demonstrate the sign test, we consider the weekly sales of Cape May Potato Chips by the Lawler Grocery Store chain. Lawler's management made the decision to carry the new potato chip product based on the manufacturer's estimate that the median sales should be $450 per week on a per store basis. After carrying the product for three-months, Lawler's management requested the following hypothesis test about the population median weekly sales.
H0: Median  450 Ha: Median 450
Data showing one-week sales at 10 randomly selected Lawler's stores are provided in Table 19.1.

Observations equal to the hypothesized value are discarded and the analysis proceeds with the observations having either a plus sign or a minus sign.

In conducting the sign test, we compare each sample observation to the hypothesized value of the population median. If the observation is greater than the hypothesized value, we record a plus sign "." If the observation is less than the hypothesized value, we record a minus sign "." If an observation is exactly equal to the hypothesized value, the observation is eliminated from the sample and the analysis proceeds with the smaller sample size, using only the observations where a plus sign or a minus sign has been recorded. It is the conversion of the sample data to either a plus sign or a minus sign that gives the nonparametric method its name: the sign test.
Consider the sample data in Table 19.1. The first observation, 485, is greater than the hypothesized median 450; a plus sign is recorded. The second observation, 562, is greater than the hypothesized median 450; a plus sign is recorded. Continuing with the 10 observations in the sample provides the plus and minus signs as shown in Table 19.2. Note that there are 7 plus signs and 3 minus signs.
The assigning of the plus signs and minus signs has made the situation a binomial distribution application. The sample size n  10 is the number of trials. There are two outcomes possible per trial, a plus sign or a minus sign, and the trials are independent. Let p denote the probability of a plus sign. If the population median is 450, p would equal .50 as there should be 50% plus signs and 50% minus signs in the population. Thus, in terms of the binomial probability p, the sign test hypotheses about the population median

H0: Median  450 Ha: Median 450
are converted to the following hypotheses about the binomial probability p.

H0: p  .50 Ha: p .50

Binomial probabilities are provided in Table 5 of Appendix B when the sample size is less than or equal to 20. Excel or Minitab can be used to provide binomial probabilities for any sample size.

If H0 cannot be rejected, we cannot conclude that p is different from .50 and thus we cannot conclude that the population median is different from 450. However, if H0 is rejected, we can conclude that p is not equal to .50 and thus the population median is not equal to 450.
With n  10 stores or trials and p  .50, we used Table 5 in Appendix B to obtain the binomial probabilities for the number of plus signs under the assumption H0 is true. These probabilities are shown in Table 19.3. Figure 19.1 shows a graphical representation of this binomial distribution.
Let us proceed to show how the binomial distribution can be used to test the hypothesis about the population median. We will use a .10 level of significance for the test. Since the observed number of plus signs for the sample data, 7, is in the upper tail of the binomial distribution, we begin by computing the probability of obtaining 7 or more plus signs. This probability is the probability of 7, 8, 9, or 10 plus signs. Adding these probabilities shown in Table 19.3, we have .1172  .0439  .0098  .0010  .1719. Since we are using a two-tailed hypothesis test, this upper tail probability is doubled to obtain the p-value  2(.1719)  .3438. With p-value > , we cannot reject H0. In terms of the binomial probability p, we cannot reject H0: p  .50, and thus we cannot reject the hypothesis that the population median is $450.
In this example, the hypothesis test about the population median was formulated as a two-tailed test. However, one-tailed sign tests about a population median are also possible. For example, we could have formulated the hypotheses as an upper tail test so that the null and alternative hypotheses would be written as follows:
H0: Median  450 Ha: Median  450
The corresponding p-value is equal to the binomial probability that the number of plus signs is greater than or equal to 7 found in the sample. This one-tailed p-value would have been .1172  .0439  .0098  .0010  .1719. If the example were converted to a lower tail test, the p-value would have been the probability of obtaining 7 or fewer plus signs.

860 Chapter 19 Nonparametric Methods

The application we have just described makes use of the binomial distribution with p  .50. The binomial probabilities provided in Table 5 of Appendix B can be used to compute the p-value when the sample size is 20 or less. With larger sample sizes, we rely on the normal distribution approximation of the binomial distribution to compute the p-value; this makes the computations quicker and easier. A large sample application of the sign test is illustrated in the following example.
One year ago the median price of a new home was $236,000. However, a current downturn in the economy has real estate firms using sample data on recent home sales to determine if the population median price of a new home is less today than it was a year ago. The hypothesis test about the population median price of a new home is as follows:

H0: Median  236,000 Ha: Median  236,000

WEB file
HomeSales

We will use a .05 level of significance to conduct this test. A random sample of 61 recent new home sales found 22 homes sold for more than
$236,000, 38 homes sold for less than $236,000, and one home sold for $236,000. After deleting the home that sold for the hypothesized median price of $236,000, the sign test continues with 22 plus signs, 38 minus signs, and a sample of 60 homes.
The null hypothesis that the population median is greater than or equal to $236,000 is expressed by the binomial distribution hypothesis H0: p  .50. If H0 were true as an equality, we would expect .50(60)  30 homes to have a plus sign. The sample result showing 22 plus signs is in the lower tail of the binomial distribution. Thus, the p-value is the probability of 22 or fewer plus signs when p  .50. While it is possible to compute the exact binomial probabilities for 0, 1, 2, . . . to 22 and sum these probabilities, we will use the normal distribution approximation of the binomial distribution to make this computation easier. For this approximation, the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution are as follows.

Distribution form: Approximately normal for n > 20

Using equations (19.1) and (19.2) with n  60 homes and p  .50, the sampling distribution of the number of plus signs can be approximated by a normal distribution with
  .50n  .50(60)  30
  .25n  .25(60)  3.873
Let us now use the normal distribution to approximate the binomial probability of 22 or fewer plus signs. Before we proceed, remember that the binomial probability distribution is discrete and the normal probability distribution is continuous. To account for this, the binomial probability of 22 is computed by the normal probability interval 21.5 to 22.5. The .5 added to and subtracted from 22 is called the continuity correction factor. Thus, to compute

the p-value for 22 or fewer plus signs we use the normal distribution with   30 and   3.873 to compute the probability that the normal random variable, x, has a value less than or equal to 22.5. A graph of this p-value is shown in Figure 19.2.
Using this normal distribution, we compute the p-value as follows:

Using the table of areas for a normal probability distribution, we see that the cumulative probability for z  1.94 provides the p-value  .0262. With .0262 < .05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the median price of a new home is less than the $236,000 median price a year ago.

NOTES AND COMMENTS

1. The examples used to illustrate a hypothesis test about a population median involved weekly sales data and home price data. The probability distributions for these types of variables are usually not symmetrical and are most often skewed to the right. In such cases, the population median rather than the population mean becomes the preferred measure of central location. In general, when the population is not symmetrical, the nonparametric sign test for the population median is often the more appropriate statistical test.

2. The binomial sampling distribution for the sign test can be used to compute a confidence interval estimate of the population median. However, the computations are rather complex and would rarely be done by hand. Statistical packages such as Minitab can be used to obtain a confidence interval for a population median. The Minitab procedure to do this is described in Appendix 19.1. Using the price of homes example in this section, Minitab provides the 95% confidence interval for the median price of a new home as $183,000 to $231,000.

862 Chapter 19 Nonparametric Methods
Hypothesis Test with Matched Samples
In Chapter 10, we introduced a matched-sample experimental design where each of n experimental units provided a pair of observations, one from population 1 and one from population 2. Using quantitative data and assuming that the differences between the pairs of matched observations were normally distributed, the t distribution was used to make an inference about the difference between the means of the two populations.
In the following example we will use the nonparametric sign test to analyze matchedsample data. Unlike the t distribution procedure, which required quantitative data and the assumption that the differences were normally distributed, the sign test enables us to analyze categorical as well as quantitative data and requires no assumption about the distribution of the differences. This type of matched-sample design occurs in market research when a sample of n potential customers is asked to compare two brands of a product such as coffee, soft drinks, or detergents. Without obtaining a quantitative measure of each individual's preference for the brands, each individual is asked to state a brand preference. Consider the following example.
Sun Coast Farms produces an orange juice product called Citrus Valley. The primary competition for Citrus Valley comes from the producer of an orange juice known as Tropical Orange. In a consumer preference comparison of the two brands, 14 individuals were given unmarked samples of the two orange juice products. The brand each individual tasted first was selected randomly. If the individual selected Citrus Valley as the more preferred, a plus sign was recorded. If the individual selected Tropical Orange as the more preferred, a minus sign was recorded. If the individual was unable to express a difference in preference for the two products, no sign was recorded. The data for the 14 individuals in the study are shown in Table 19.4.
Deleting the two individuals who could not express a preference for either brand, the data have been converted to a sign test with 2 plus signs and 10 minus signs for the n  12 individuals who could express a preference for one of the two brands. Letting p indicate the proportion of the population of customers who prefer Citrus Valley orange juice, we want to test the hypotheses that there is no difference between the preferences for the two brands as follows:
H0: p  .50 Ha: p .50
If H0 cannot be rejected, we cannot conclude that there is a difference in preference for the two brands. However, if H0 can be rejected, we can conclude that the consumer preferences differ for the two brands. We will use a .05 level of significance for this hypothesis test.
We will conduct the sign test exactly as we did earlier in this section. The sampling distribution for the number of plus signs is a binomial distribution with p  .50 and n  12.

Using Table 5 in Appendix B we obtain the binomial probabilities for the number of plus signs, as shown in Table 19.5. Under the assumption H0 is true, we would expect .50n  .50(12)  6 plus signs. With only two plus signs in the sample, the results are in the lower tail of the binomial distribution. To compute the p-value for this two-tailed test, we first compute the probability of 2 or fewer plus signs and then double this value. Using the binomial probabilities of 0, 1, and 2 shown in Table 19.5, the p-value is 2(.0002  .0029  .0161)  .0384. With .0384 < .05, we reject H0. The taste test provides evidence that consumer preference differs significantly for the two brands of orange juice. We would advise Sun Coast Farms of this result and conclude that the competitor's Tropical Orange product is the more preferred. Sun Coast Farms can then pursue a strategy to address this issue.
Similar to other uses of the sign test, one-tailed tests may be used depending upon the application. Also, as the sample size becomes large, the normal distribution approximation of the binomial distribution will ease the computations as shown earlier in this section. While the Sun Coast Farms sign test for matched samples used categorical preference data, the sign test for matched samples can be used with quantitative data as well. This would be particularly helpful if the paired differences are not normally distributed and are skewed. In this case a positive difference is assigned a plus sign, a negative difference is assigned a negative sign, and a zero difference is removed from the sample. The sign test computations proceed as before.

19.2 Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

If the population of differences is skewed, the sign test for matched samples presented in Section 19.1 is recommended.

In Chapter 10, we introduced a matched-sample experimental design where each of n experimental units provided a pair of observations, one from population 1 and one from population 2. The parametric test for this experiment requires quantitative data and the assumption that the differences between the paired observations are normally distributed. The t distribution can then be used to make an inference about the difference between the means of the two populations.
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a nonparametric procedure for analyzing data from a matched-sample experiment. The test uses quantitative data but does not require the assumption that the differences between the paired observations are normally distributed. It only requires the assumption that the differences between the paired observations have a symmetric distribution. This occurs whenever the shapes of the two populations are the same and the focus is on determining if there is a difference between the medians of the two populations. Let us demonstrate the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with the following example.
Consider a manufacturing firm that is attempting to determine whether two production methods differ in terms of task completion time. Using a matched-samples experimental design, 11 randomly selected workers completed the production task two times, once using method A and once using method B. The production method that the worker used first was randomly selected. The completion times for the two methods and the differences between the completion times are shown in Table 19.6. A positive difference indicates that method

The examples in this section take the point of view that the two populations have the same shape and if they do differ, it is only in location. This enables the hypotheses for the Wilcoxon signedrank test to be stated in terms of the population medians.
Differences of 0 are discarded and the analysis continues with the smaller sample size involving the nonzero differences.
Ties among absolute differences are assigned the average of their ranks.

A required more time; a negative difference indicates that method B required more time. Do the data indicate that the two production methods differ significantly in terms of completion times? If we assume that the differences have a symmetric distribution but not necessarily a normal distribution, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test applies.
In particular, we will use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the difference between the median completion times for the two production methods. The hypotheses are as follows:
H0: Median for method A  Median for method B  0 Ha: Median for method A  Median for method B 0
If H0 cannot be rejected, we will not be able to conclude that the median completion times are different. However, if H0 is rejected, we will conclude that the median completion times are different. We will use a .05 level of significance for the test.
The first step in the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is to discard the difference of zero for worker 8 and then compute the absolute value of the differences for the remaining 10 workers as shown in column 3 of Table 19.7. Next we rank these absolute differences from lowest to highest as shown in column 4. The smallest absolute difference of .1 for worker 7 is assigned the rank of 1. The second smallest absolute difference of .2 for worker 2 is assigned the rank of 2. This ranking of absolute differences continues with the largest absolute difference of .9 for worker 6 being assigned the rank of 10. The tied absolute differences of .4 for workers 3 and 5 are assigned the average rank of 3.5. Similarly, the tied absolute differences of .5 for workers 4 and 10 are assigned the average rank of 5.5.
Once the ranks of the absolute differences have been determined, each rank is given the sign of the original difference for the worker. The negative signed ranks are placed in column 5 and the positive signed ranks are placed in column 6 (see Table 19.7). For example, the difference for worker 1 was a positive .7 (see column 2) and the rank of the absolute difference was 8 (see column 4). Thus, the rank for worker 1 is shown as a positive signed rank in column 6. The difference for worker 2 was a negative .2 and the rank of the absolute difference was 2. Thus, the rank for worker 2 is shown as a negative signed rank of 2 in column 5. Continuing this process generates the negative and positive signed ranks as shown in Table 19.7.

Let T  denote the sum of the positive signed ranks, which is T   49.5. To conduct the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we will use T  as the test statistic. If the medians of the two populations are equal and the number of matched pairs is 10 or more, the sampling distribution of T  can be approximated by a normal distribution as follows.

Figure 19.3 shows the sampling distribution of the T  test statistic. Let us compute the two-tailed p-value for the hypothesis that the median completion
times for the two production methods are equal. Since the test statistic T  49.5 is in the upper tail of the sampling distribution, we begin by computing the upper tail probability P(T   49.5). Since the sum of the positive ranks T  is discrete and the normal distribution is continuous, we will obtain the best approximation by including the continuity

correction factor. Thus, the discrete probability of T 49.5 is approximated by the normal probability interval, 49 to 50, and the probability that T  49.5 is approximated by:

Using the standard normal distribution table and z  2.19, we see that the two-tailed p-value  2(1.9857)  .0286. With the p-value  .05, we reject H0 and conclude that the median completion times for the two production methods are not equal. With T  being in the upper tail of the sampling distribution, we see that method A led to the longer completion times. We would expect management to conclude that method B is the faster or better production method.
One-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are possible. For example, if initially we had been looking for statistical evidence to conclude method A had the larger median completion time and method B has the smaller median completion time, we would have formulated an upper tail hypothesis test as follows:

H0: Median for method A  Median for method B  0 Ha: Median for method A  Median for method B  0

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test can be used to test the hypothesis about the median of a symmetric population. If the population is skewed, the sign test presented in Section 19.1 is preferred.

Rejecting H0 would provide the conclusion that method A has the greater median completion time and method B has the smaller median completion time. Lower tail hypothesis tests are also possible.
As a final note, in Section 19.1 we showed how the sign test could be used for both a hypothesis test about a population median and a hypothesis test with matched samples. In this section, we have demonstrated the use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for a hypothesis test with matched samples. However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test can also be used for a nonparametric test about a population median. This test makes no assumption about the population distribution other than that it is symmetric. If this assumption is appropriate, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is the preferred nonparametric test for a population median. However, if the population is skewed, the sign test presented in Section 19.1 is preferred. With the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the differences between the observations and the hypothesized value of the population median are used instead of the differences between the matched-pair observations. Otherwise the calculations are exactly as shown in this section. Exercise 17 will ask you to use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to conduct a hypothesis test about the median of a symmetric population.

NOTES AND COMMENTS

1. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test for a population median is based on the assumption that the population is symmetric. With this assumption, the population median is equal to the population mean. Thus, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test can also be used as a test about the mean of a symmetric population.

2. The Wilcoxon signed-rank procedure can also be used to compute a confidence interval for the median of a symmetric population. However, the computations are rather complex and would rarely be done by hand. Statistical packages such as Minitab can be used to obtain this confidence interval.

Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test
In Chapter 10, we introduced a procedure for conducting a hypothesis test about the difference between the means of two populations using two independent samples, one from population 1 and one from population 2. This parametric test required quantitative data and the assumption that both populations had a normal distribution. In the case where the population standard deviations 1 and 2 were unknown, the sample standard deviations s1 and s2 provided estimates of 1 and 2 and the t distribution was used to make an inference about the difference between the means of the two populations.
In this section we present a nonparametric test for the difference between two populations based on two independent samples. Advantages of this nonparametric procedure are that it can be used with either ordinal data1 or quantitative data and it does not require the assumption that the populations have a normal distribution. Versions of the test were developed jointly by Mann and Whitney and also by Wilcoxon. As a result, the test has been referred to as the Mann-Whitney test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The tests are equivalent and both versions provide the same conclusion. In this section, we will refer to this nonparametric test as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test.

1Ordinal data are categorical data that can be rank ordered. This scale of measurement was discussed more fully in Section 1.2 of Chapter 1.

872 Chapter 19 Nonparametric Methods
We begin the MWW test by stating the most general form of the null and alternative hypotheses as follows:
H0: The two populations are identical Ha: The two populations are not identical
The alternative hypothesis that the two populations are not identical requires some clarification. If H0 is rejected, we are using the test to conclude that the populations are not identical and that population 1 tends to provide either smaller or larger values than population 2. A situation where population 1 tends to provide smaller values than population 2 is shown in Figure 19.4. Note that it is not necessary that all values from population 1 be less than all values from population 2. However, the figure correctly shows, the conclusion that Ha is true; the two populations are not identical and population 1 tends to provide smaller values than population 2. In a two-tailed test, we consider the alternative hypothesis that either population may provide the smaller or larger values. One-tailed versions of the test can be formulated with the alternative hypothesis that population 1 provides either the smaller or the larger values compared to population 2.
We will first illustrate the MWW test using small samples with rank-ordered data. This will give you an understanding of how the rank-sum statistic is computed and how it is used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis that the two populations are identical. Later in the section, we will introduce a large-sample approximation based on the normal distribution that will simplify the calculations required by the MWW test.
Let us consider the on-the-job performance ratings for employees at a Showtime Cinemas 20-screen multiplex movie theater. During an employee performance review, the theater manager rated all 35 employees from best (rating 1) to worst (rating 35) in the theater's annual report. Knowing that the part-time employees were primarily college and high school students, the district manager asked if there was evidence of a significant difference in performance for college students compared to high school students. In terms of the population of college students and the population of high school students who could be considered for employment at the theater, the hypotheses were stated as follows:
H0: College and high school student populations are identical in terms of performance Ha: College and high school student populations are not identical in terms of performance
We will use a .05 level of significance for this test. We begin by selecting a random sample of four college students and a random sample
of five high school students working at Showtime Cinemas. The theater manager's overall performance rating based on all 35 employees was recorded for each of these employees, as shown in Table 19.8. The first college student selected was rated 15th in the manager's annual performance report, the second college student selected was rated 3rd in the manager's annual performance report, and so on.

The data in this example show how the MWW test can be used with ordinal (rank-ordered) data. Exercise 17 provides another application that uses this type of data.

The next step in the MWW procedure is to rank the combined samples from low to high. Since there is a total of 9 students, we rank the performance rating data in Table 19.8 from 1 to 9. The lowest value of 3 for college student 2 receives a rank of 1 and the second lowest value of 8 for college student 4 receives a rank of 2. The highest value of 32 for high school student 3 receives a rank of 9. The combined-sample ranks for all 9 students are shown in Table 19.9.
Next we sum the ranks for each sample as shown in Table 19.9. The MWW procedure may use the sum of the ranks for either sample. However, in our application of the MWW test we will follow the common practice of using the first sample which is the sample of four college students. The sum of ranks for the first sample will be the test statistic W for the MWW test. This sum, as shown in Table 19.9, is W  4  1  7  2  14.
Let us consider why the sum of the ranks will help us select between the two hypotheses: H0: The two populations are identical and Ha: The two populations are not identical. Letting C denote a college student and H denote a high school student, suppose the ranks of the nine students had the following order with the four college students having the four lowest ranks.
Rank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Student C C C C H H H H H
Notice that this permutation or ordering separates the two samples, with the college students all having a lower rank than the high school students. This is a strong indication that the two populations are not identical. The sum of ranks for the college students in this case is W  1  2  3  4  10.

Now consider a ranking where the four college students have the four highest ranks.
Rank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Student H H H H H C C C C
Notice that this permutation or ordering separates the two samples again, but this time the college students all have a higher rank than the high school students. This is another strong indication that the two populations are not identical. The sum of ranks for the college students in this case is W  6  7  8  9  30. Thus, we see that the sum of the ranks for the college students must be between 10 and 30. Values of W near 10 imply that college students have lower ranks than the high school students, whereas values of W near 30 imply that college students have higher ranks than the high school students. Either of these extremes would signal the two populations are not identical. However, if the two populations are identical, we would expect a mix in the ordering of the C's and H's so that the sum of ranks W is closer to the average of the two extremes, or nearer to (10  30)/2  20.
Making the assumption that the two populations are identical, we used a computer program to compute all possible orderings for the nine students. For each ordering, we computed the sum of the ranks for the college students. This provided the probability distribution showing the exact sampling distribution of W in Figure 19.5. The exact probabilities associated with the values of W are summarized in Table 19.10. While we will not ask you to generate this exact sampling distribution, we will use it to test the hypothesis that the two populations of students are identical.
Let us use the sampling distribution of W in Figure 19.5 to compute the p-value for the test just as we have done using other sampling distributions. Table 19.9 shows that the sum of ranks for the four college student is W  14. Because this value of W is in the lower tail of the sampling distribution, we begin by computing the lower tail probability P(W  14). Thus, we have
P(W  14)  P(10)  P(11)  P(12)  P(13)  P(14)  .0079  .0079  .0159  .0238  .0397  .0952

Doing the ranking of the combined samples by hand will take some time. Computer routines can be used to do this ranking quickly and efficiently.

The two-tailed p-value  2(.0952)  .1904. With   .05 as the level of significance and p-value  .05, the MWW test conclusion is that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the populations of college and high school students are identical. While the sample of four college students and the sample of five high school students did not provide statistical evidence to conclude there is a difference between the two populations, this is an ideal time to suggest withholding judgment. Further study with larger samples should be considered before drawing a final conclusion.
Most applications of the MWW test involve larger sample sizes than shown in this first example. For such applications, a large sample approximation of the sampling distribution of W based on the normal distribution is employed. In fact, note that the sampling distribution of W in Figure 19.5 shows a normal distribution is a pretty good approximation for sample sizes as small as four and five. We will use the same combined-sample ranking procedure that we used in the previous example but will use the normal distribution approximation rather than the exact sampling distribution of W to compute the p-value and draw the conclusion.
We illustrate the use of the normal distribution approximation for the MWW test by considering the situation at Third National Bank. The bank manager is monitoring the balances maintained in checking accounts at two branch banks and is wondering if the populations of account balances at the two branch banks are identical. Two independent samples of checking accounts are taken with sample sizes n1  12 at branch 1 and n2  10 at branch 2. The data are shown in Table 19.11.
As before, the first step in the MWW test is to rank the combined data from the lowest to highest values. Using the combined 22 observations in Table 19.11, we find the smallest value of $750 (Branch 2 Account 6) and assign it a rank of 1. The second smallest value of $800 (Branch 2 Account 5) is assigned a rank of 2. The third smallest value of 805 (Branch 1 Account 7) is assigned a rank of 3, and so on. In ranking the combined data, we may find that two or more values are the same. In that case, the tied values are assigned the average rank of their positions in the combined data set. For example, the balance of $950 occurs for both Branch 1 Account 6 and Branch 2 Account 4. In the combined data set, the two values of $950 are in positions 12 and 13 when the combined data are ranked from low to high. As a result, these two accounts are assigned the average rank (12  13)/2  12.5. Table 19.12 shows the assigned ranks for the combined samples.

previously, we will always follow the procedure of using the sum of the ranks for sample 1 as the test statistic W. Thus, we have W  169.5. When both samples sizes are 7 or more, a normal approximation of the sampling distribution of W can be used. Under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and the populations are identical, the sampling distribution of the test statistic W is as follows.

SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF W WITH IDENTICAL POPULATIONS
Mean: W  1/2n1(n1  n2  1)
Standard deviation: W   112 n1n2(n1  n2  1)
Distribution form: Approximately normal provided n1  7 and n2  7

(19.5) (19.6)

Given the sample sizes n1  12 and n2  10, equations (19.5) and (19.6) provide the following mean and standard deviation for the sampling distribution:
W  1/2n1(n1  n2  1)  1/2(12)(12  10  1)  138
W   112 n1n2(n1  n2  1)   112 (12)(10)(12  10  1)  15.1658
Figure 19.6 shows the normal distribution used for the sampling distribution of W. Let us proceed with the MWW test and use a .05 level of significance to draw a con-
clusion. Since the test statistic W is discrete and the normal distribution is continuous, we will again use the continuity correction factor for the normal distribution approximation.

If the assumption can be made that the two populations have the same shape, the MWW test becomes a test about the difference between the medians of the two populations.

With W  169.5 in the upper tail of the sampling distribution, we have the following p-value calculation:

Using the standard normal random variable and z  2.04, the two-tailed p-value = 2(1.9793) = .0414. With p-value  .05, reject H0 and conclude that the two populations of account balances are not identical. The upper tail value for test statistic W indicates that the population of account balances at branch 1 tends to be larger.
As a final comment, some applications of the MWW test make it appropriate to assume that the two populations have identical shapes and if the populations differ, it is only by a shift in the location of the distributions. If the two populations have the same shape, the hypothesis test may be stated in terms of the difference between the two population medians. Any difference between the medians can be interpreted as the shift in location of one population compared to the other. In this case, the three forms of the MWW test about the medians of the two populations are as follows:

Two-Tailed Test
H0: Median1  Median2  0 Ha: Median1  Median2 0

Lower Tail Test
H0: Median1  Median2  0 Ha: Median1  Median2  0

Upper Tail Test
H0: Median1  Median2  0 Ha: Median1  Median2  0

NOTES AND COMMENTS

The Minitab procedure for the MWW test is described in Appendix 19.1. Minitab makes the assumption that the two populations have the same shape. As a result, Minitab describes the test results in terms of a test about the medians of the two

populations. If you do not feel comfortable making the "same shape" assumption, Minitab results are still applicable. However, you need to interpret the results as a test of the null hypothesis that the two populations are identical.

19.4 Kruskal-Wallis Test
In this section we extend the nonparametric procedures to hypothesis tests involving three or more populations. We considered a parametric test for this situation in Chapter 13 when we used quantitative data and assumed that the populations had normal distributions with the same standard deviations. Based on an independent random sample from each population, we used the F distribution to test for differences among the population means.
The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test is based on the analysis of independent random samples from each of k populations. This procedure can be used with either ordinal data or quantitative data and does not require the assumption that the populations have normal distributions. The general form of the null and alternative hypotheses is as follows:
H0: All populations are identical Ha: Not all populations are identical
If H0 is rejected, we will conclude that there is a difference among the populations with one or more populations tending to provide smaller or larger values compared to the other populations. We will demonstrate the Kruskal-Wallis test using the following example.

Williams Manufacturing Company hires employees for its management staff from three different colleges. Recently, the company's personnel director began reviewing the annual performance reports for the management staff in an attempt to determine whether there are differences in the performance ratings among the managers who graduated from the three colleges. Performance rating data are available for independent samples of seven managers who graduated from college A, six managers who graduated from college B, and seven managers who graduated from college C. These data are summarized in Table 19.14. The performance rating shown for each manger is recorded on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest possible rating. Suppose we want to test whether the three populations of managers are identical in terms of performance ratings. We will use a .05 level of significance for the test.
The first step in the Kruskal-Wallis procedure is to rank the combined samples from lowest to highest values. Using all 20 observations in Table 19.14, the lowest rating of 15 for the 4th manager in the college B sample receives a rank of 1. The highest rating of 95 for the 5th manager in the college A sample receives a rank of 20. The performance rating data and their assigned ranks are shown in Table 19.15. Note that we assigned the average ranks to tied performance ratings of 60, 70, 80, and 90. Table 19.15 also shows the sum of ranks for each of the three samples.
The Kruskal-Wallis test statistic uses the sum of the ranks for the three samples and is computed as follows.

If the assumption can be made that the populations all have the same shape, the Kruskal-Wallis test becomes a test about the medians of the k populations.

Kruskal and Wallis were able to show that, under the null hypothesis assumption of identical populations, the sampling distribution of H can be approximated by a chi-square distribution with (k  1) degrees of freedom. This approximation is generally acceptable if the sample sizes for each of the k populations are all greater than or equal to five. The null hypothesis of identical populations will be rejected if the test statistic H is large. As a result, the Kruskal-Wallis test is always expressed as an upper tail test. The computation of the test statistic for the sample data in Table 19.15 is as follows.
The sample sizes are

n1  7 n2  6 n3  7
and
3
nT  nt  7  6  7  20 i1
Using the sum of ranks for each sample, the value of the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is as follows:

    H 

12 k Ri2 nT (nT  1) i1 ni



3(nT

12 20(21)

(95)2 (27)2 (88)2 7 67

 3(20 1)  8.92

We can now use the chi-square distribution table (Table 3 of Appendix B) to determine the p-value for the test. Using k  1  3  1  2 degrees of freedom, we find 2  7.378 has an area of .025 in the upper tail of the chi-square distribution and 2  9.21 has an area of .01 in the upper tail of the chi-square distribution. With H  8.92 between 7.378 and 9.21, we can conclude that the area in the upper tail of the chi-square distribution is between .025 and .01. Because this is an upper tail test, we conclude that the p-value is between .025 and .01. Using Minitab or Excel will show the exact p-value for 2  8.92 is .0116. Because p-value    .05, we reject H0 and conclude that the three populations are not all the same. The three populations of performance ratings are not identical and differ significantly depending upon the college. Because the sum of the ranks is relatively low for the sample of managers who graduated from college B, it would be reasonable for the company to either reduce its recruiting from college B, or at least evaluate the college B graduates more thoroughly before making a hiring decision.
As a final comment, we note that in some applications of the Kruskal-Wallis test it may be appropriate to make the assumption that the populations have identical shapes and if they differ, it is only by a shift in location for one or more of the populations. If the k populations are assumed to have the same shape, the hypothesis test can be stated in terms of the population medians. In this case, the hypotheses for the Kruskal-Wallis test would be written as follows:

H0: Median1  Median2  . . .  Mediank Ha: Not all Medians are equal

NOTES AND COMMENTS
1. The example in this section used quantitative data on employee performance ratings to conduct the Kruskal-Wallis test. This test could also have been used if the data were the ordinal rankings of the 20 employees in terms of

performance. In this case, the test would use the ordinal data directly. The step of converting the quantitative data into rank-ordered data would not be necessary. Exercise 30 illustrates this situation.

19.4 Kruskal-Wallis Test
2. The Minitab procedure for the Kruskal-Wallis test is described in Appendix 19.1. Minitab makes the assumption that the populations all have the same shape. As a result, Minitab describes the KruskalWallis test as a test of differences among the

885
population medians. If you do not feel comfortable making the "same shape" assumption, you can still use Minitab. However, you will need to interpret the results as a test of the null hypothesis that all populations are identical.

Rank Correlation
The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient introduced in Chapter 3 is a measure of the linear association between two variables using quantitative data. In this section, we provide a correlation measure of association between two variables when ordinal or rankordered data are available. The Spearman rank-correlation coefficient has been developed for this purpose.

Let us illustrate the use of the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient. A company wants to determine whether individuals who had a greater potential at the time of employment turn out to have higher sales records. To investigate, the personnel director reviewed the original job interview reports, academic records, and letters of recommendation for 10 current members of the sales force. After the review, the director ranked the 10 individuals in terms of their potential for success at the time of employment and assigned the individual who had the most potential the rank of 1. Data were then collected on the actual sales for each individual during their first two years of employment. On the basis of the actual sales records, a second ranking of the 10 individuals based on sales performance was obtained. Table 19.16 provides the ranks based on potential as well as the ranks based on the actual performance.
Let us compute the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient for the data in Table 19.16. The computations are summarized in Table 19.17. We first compute the difference between the two ranks for each salesperson, di, as shown in column 4. The sum of the di2 in column 5 is 44. This value and the sample size n  10 are used to compute the rank-correlation coefficient rs  .733 shown in Table 19.17.
The Spearman rank-correlation coefficient ranges from 1.0 to 1.0 and its interpretation is similar to the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient for quantitative data. A rank-correlation coefficient near 1.0 indicates a strong positive association between the

ranks for the two variables, while a rank-correlation coefficient near 1.0 indicates a strong negative association between the ranks for the two variables. A rank-correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no association between the ranks for the two variables. In the example, rs  .733 indicates a positive correlation between the ranks based on potential and the ranks based on sales performance. Individuals who ranked higher in potential at the time of employment tended to rank higher in two-year sales performance.
At this point, we may want to use the sample rank correlation rs to make an inference about the population rank correlation coefficient s. To do this, we test the following hypotheses:

19.2, we show how Minitab and Excel correlation tools for the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient can be used to compute the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient.

Summary
In this chapter we have presented statistical procedures that are classified as nonparametric methods. Because these methods can be applied to categorical data as well as quantitative data and because they do not require an assumption about the distribution of the population, they expand the number of situations that can be subjected to statistical analysis.

892 Chapter 19 Nonparametric Methods
The sign test is a nonparametric procedure for testing a hypothesis about a population median or for testing a hypothesis with matched samples. The data must be summarized in two categories, one denoted by a plus sign and one denoted by a minus sign. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test analyzes matched samples from two populations when quantitative data are available. No assumption is required other than the distribution of the paired differences is symmetric. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to determine if the median of the population of paired differences is zero. This test can also be used to make inferences about the median of a symmetric population.
The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test is a nonparametric procedure for the difference between two populations based on two independent samples. It is an alternative to the parametric t test for the difference between the means of the two populations. The combined ranks for the data from the two samples are obtained and the test statistic for the MWW test is the sum of ranks for the first sample. In most applications, the samples sizes are large enough to use a normal approximation with the continuity correction factor in conducting the hypothesis test. If no assumption is made about the populations, the MWW procedure tests whether the two populations are identical. If the assumption can be made that the two populations have the same shape, the test provides an inference about the difference between the medians of the two populations.
The Kruskal-Wallis test extends the MWW test to three or more populations. It is an alternative to the parametric analysis of variance test for the differences among the means of three or more normally distributed populations. The Kruskal-Wallis test does not require any assumption about the distribution of the populations and uses the null hypothesis that the k populations are identical. If the assumption can be made that the populations have the same shape, the test provides an inference about differences among the medians of the k populations. In the last section of the chapter we introduced the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient as a measure of association between two variables based on rank-ordered data.
Glossary
Parametric methods Statistical methods that begin with an assumption about the probability distribution of the population which is often that the population has a normal distribution. A sampling distribution for the test statistic can then be derived and used to make an inference about one or more parameters of the population such as the population mean µ or the population standard deviation . Nonparametric methods Statistical methods that require no assumption about the form of the probability distribution of the population and are often referred to as distribution-free methods. Several of the methods can be applied with categorical as well as quantitative data. Distribution-free methods Statistical methods that make no assumption about the probability distribution of the population. Sign test A nonparametric test for a hypothesis about a population median or for identifying differences between two populations based on matched samples. The data are summarized in two categories, denoted by a plus sign or a minus sign, and the binomial distribution with p  .50 provides the sampling distribution for the test statistic. Wilcoxon signed-rank test A nonparametric test for the difference between the medians of two populations based on matched samples. The procedure uses quantitative data and is based on the assumption that the distribution of differences is symmetric. The paireddifference data are used to make an inference about the medians of the two populations. This test can also be used to make inferences about the median of a symmetric population. Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test A nonparametric test for the difference between two populations based on an independent sample from each population. The null hypothesis is that the two populations are identical. If the assumption can be made that the populations have the same shape, this test provides an inference about the difference between the medians of the two populations.

Step 1. Select the Stat menu Step 2. Choose Nonparametrics Step 3. Choose 1-Sample Sign Step 4. When the 1-Sample Sign dialogue box appears:
Enter C1 in the Variables box Select Test Median Enter the hypothesized value 236000 in the Test Median box Select less than from the Alternative menu Click OK
Minitab provides the p-value as well as a point estimate of the population median. This Minitab procedure can also be used to obtain an interval estimate of the popula-
tion median. In step 4, select Confidence interval instead of Test median, enter the Confidence level, and click OK. For sample sizes greater than 50, Minitab uses a normal approximation to the binomial sampling distribution with the continuity correction factor for both the hypothesis test and the confidence interval calculations.

SunCoast

Sign Test for a Hypothesis Test with Matched Samples
In order to use Minitab's sign test procedure for a hypothesis test with matched samples, we will use a numerical code for a plus sign, a minus sign, and the no preference data. We will use the Sun Coast Farms hypothesis test in Section 19.1 to illustrate this procedure. The data file SunCoast shows that column C1 contains numbers identifying each of the 14 individuals participating in the taste test and that column C2 uses a  1 for each plus sign, a  1 for each minus sign and a 0 for each no preference. If the null hypothesis of no preference is true, the median of the population of 1's, 1's, and 0's will be zero. Thus, we follow the steps for testing a population median with the median hypothesized to be zero. For the Sun Coast Farms hypothesis test we will use a two-tailed test as follows.

Step 1. Select the Stat menu Step 2. Choose Nonparametrics Step 3. Choose 1-Sample Sign Step 4. When the 1-Sample Sign dialogue box appears:
Enter C2 in the Variables box Select Test Median Enter the hypothesized value 0 in the Test Median box Select not equal from the Alternative menu Click OK

MatchedSample

The following steps can be used to test hypotheses about the difference between two population medians using matched-sample data. We will use the production task completion time data in Section 19.2 to illustrate. The data file MatchedSample provides the production times for method A in column C1, the production times for method B in column C2, and the differences in column C3. The following steps can be used to test the hypotheses H0: Median  0 and Ha: Median 0 for the population of differences.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu Step 2. Choose Nonparametrics Step 3. Choose 1-Sample Wilcoxon

898 Chapter 19 Nonparametric Methods

Step 4. When the 1-Sample Wilcoxon dialogue box appears: Enter C3 in the Variables box Select Test Median Enter the hypothesized value 0 in the Test Median box Select not equal from the Alternative menu Click OK
Note that the Minitab procedure uses the paired difference data in column C3. Although the data file shows the times for each production method in columns C1 and C2, these data were not used to obtain the Minitab output.
The same procedure can also be used to test a hypothesis about the median of a symmetric population. Enter the actual data in any column of the worksheet and follow the preceding steps. Enter the hypothesized value of the population median in the Test Median box and select the desired alternative hypothesis in the Alternative box. Click OK to obtain the results. For this test, you do not have to enter the difference data. The Minitab routine will make the calculations automatically. But remember, this test is valid for only the median of a symmetric population.

ThirdNational

Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test
The following steps can be used to test a hypothesis that two populations are identical using two independent samples, one from each population. We will use the Third National Bank example in Section 19.3 to illustrate. The data file ThirdNational provides the 12 account balances for branch 1 in column C1 and the ten account balances for branch 2 in column C2. The following steps will implement the Minitab procedure for testing H0: The two populations are identical versus Ha: The two populations are not identical.
Step 1. Select the Stat menu Step 2. Choose Nonparametrics Step 3. Choose Mann-Whitney Step 4. When the Mann-Whitney dialogue box appears:
Enter C1 in the First sample box Enter C2 in the Second sample box Select not equal from the Alternative menu Click OK
Minitab will report the value of the test statistic and the corresponding p-value for the test. Since Minitab automatically assumes the two populations have the same shape, the output describes the results in terms of the difference between the medians of the two populations. Note that the output also provides both a point estimate and a confidence interval estimate of the difference between the medians. With the Greek letter  (eta) sometimes used to denote a population median, the Minitab output uses ETA1 and ETA2 as abbreviations for the two population medians.

Williams

Kruskal-Wallis Test
The following steps can be used to test a hypothesis that three or more populations are identical using independent samples, one from each population. We will use the Williams Manufacturing Company data in Section 19.4 to illustrate. The data file Williams provides the college the employee attended (A, B, or C) in column C1 and the annual performance rating in column C2. Minitab's terminology is to refer to the college as the factor and the performance rating as the response. The following steps will implement the Minitab procedure for testing H0: All populations are identical versus Ha: Not all populations are identical. If the assumption is made that the populations have the same shape, the hypotheses can be stated in terms of the population medians.

Spearman Rank Correlation
The Spearman rank-correlation coefficient is the same as the Pearson correlation coefficient computed for the ordinal, or rank-ordered, data. So we can compute the Spearman rankcorrelation coefficient for the rank-ordered data by using Minitab's procedure to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient. We will use the sales potential and actual two-year sales data in Section 19.5 to illustrate. The data file PotentialActual provides the ranking of potential of each employee in column C2 and the ranking of the actual two-year sales of each employee in column C3. The following Minitab steps can be used to calculate Spearman's rank correlation for the two variables.

Step 1. Select the Stat menu Step 2. Choose Basic Statistics Step 3. Choose Correlation Step 4. When the Correlation dialogue box appears:
Enter C2 C3 in the Variables box Uncheck Display p-values Click OK

The Minitab output provides a value of .733 for the Pearson correlation coefficient. Since the data were rank-ordered data, this is also the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient. However, the p-value for the Pearson correlation coefficient is not appropriate for rankordered data and should not be interpreted as the p-value for the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient.

Appendix 19.2 Nonparametric Methods with Excel
Excel does not have nonparametric procedures in its Data Analysis package. But we will show how Excel's BINOMDIST function can be used to conduct a sign test and how a Data Analysis procedure can be used to compute a rank-correlation coefficient. The StatTools Excel add-in can be used for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test (see Appendix 19.3).
Sign Test
The sign test uses a binomial sampling distribution with p  .50 to conduct a hypothesis test about a population median or a hypothesis test with matched samples. Excel's BINOMDIST function can be used to compute exact binomial probabilities for these tests. Since the BINOMDIST probabilities are exact, there is no need to use the normal distribution approximation calculation when using Excel for the sign test.

900 Chapter 19 Nonparametric Methods

Let x  the number of plus signs n  the sample size for the observations with a plus sign or a minus sign
The BINOMDIST function can be used as follows:
Lower tail probability  BINOMDIST(x, n, .50, True) Upper tail probability  1  BINOMDIST(x  1, n, .50, True)
You can see from the lower tail probability expression, the BINOMDIST function provides the cumulative binomial probability of less than or equal to x. The .50 in the function is the value of p  .50 and the term True is used to obtain the cumulative binomial probability. The upper tail probability is 1  (the cumulative probability) as shown. Note that since the binomial distribution is discrete, (x  1) is used in the upper tail probability calculation. For example, the upper tail probability P(x  7)  1  P(x  6).
Using Excel for the Lawler Grocery Store hypothesis test about a population median, we have 7 plus signs and 3 minus signs for the sample of 10 stores. The number of plus signs was in the upper tail with P(x  7) given by the function
 1  BINOMDIST(x  1, n, .50, True)  1  BINOMDIST(6, 10, .50, True)  .1719
Since this is a two-tailed hypothesis test, we have p-value  2(.1719)  .3438. In Section 19.1 we also considered the lower tail test about the population median price
of a new home: H0: Median  236,000 Ha: Median  236,000
After deleting the home that sold for exactly $236,000, the sample provided 22 plus signs and 38 minus signs for a sample of 60 homes. Since this is a lower tail test, the p-value is given by the lower tail probability P(x  22), which is as follows:
BINOMDIST(x, n, .50, True)  BINOMDIST(22, 60, .50, True)  .0259
By using the BINOMDIST function, we have the capability of computing the exact p-value for any application of the sign test.

Spearman Rank Correlation
Excel does not have a specific procedure for computing the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient. However, this correlation coefficient is the same as the Pearson correlation coefficient provided you are using rank-ordered data. As a result, we can compute the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient by applying Excel's Pearson correlation coefficient procedure to the rank-ordered data. We illustrate using the data on sales potential and actual two-year sales from Section 19.5. The data file PotentialActual provides the ranking of the 10 individuals in terms of potential in column B and the ranking of the 10 individuals in terms of actual two-year sales in column C. The following steps provide the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient.
Step 1. Click the Data tab on the Ribbon Step 2. In the Analysis group, click Data Analysis Step 3. Choose Correlation from the list of Analysis Tools Step 4. When the Correlation Dialog box appears
Enter B1:C11 in the Input Range box Select Grouped by Columns Select Labels in First Row Select Output Range Enter D1 in the Output Range box Click OK
The Spearman rank-correlation coefficient will appear in cell E3.

Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Matched Samples
The following steps can be used to test hypotheses about the difference between two population medians based on matched samples. We will use the production task completion time data in Section 19.2 to illustrate. The data file MatchedSample provides the production times for method A in column A, the production times for method B in column B, and the differences between the two methods in column C. Begin by using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set using the procedure described in the appendix to Chapter 1. The following steps can then be used to test the hypotheses H0: Median  0 and Ha: Median 0 for the population of differences.

Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon Step 2. In the Analyses Group, select Nonparametric Tests Step 3. Choose Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Step 4. When the Wilcoxon Sign-Rank Test dialogue box appears:
Select One-Sample Analysis in the Analysis Type box Check the Difference variable Enter 0 in the Null Hypothesis Value box Select Not Equal to Null Value in the Alternative Hypothesis box Click OK
The same procedure can also be used to test a hypothesis about the median of a symmetric population. Enter the data in any column of the worksheet. Then follow the preceding steps. Enter the hypothesized value of the population median in the Null Hypothesis Value box and select the desired alternative hypothesis in the Alternative Hypothesis box. Click OK to obtain the results. For this test, you do not have to enter the difference data because the StatTools routine will make the calculations automatically. But remember, this test is valid only for the median of a symmetric population.

Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test
The following steps can be used to test a hypothesis that two populations are identical using two independent samples, one from each population. We will use the Third National Bank example in Section 19.3 to illustrate. The data file ThirdNational provides the 12 account balances for branch 1 in column A and the 10 account balances for branch 2 in column B. Begin by using the Data Set Manager to create a StatTools data set using the procedure described in the appendix to Chapter 1. The following steps can then be used for testing the hypotheses H0: The two populations are identical and Ha: The two populations are not identical.

Step 1. Click the StatTools tab on the Ribbon Step 2. In the Analyses Group, select Nonparametric Tests Step 3. Choose Mann-Whitney Test Step 4. When the Mann-Whitney Test dialogue box appears:
Select General Version in the Analysis Type box Check the Branch 1 variable Check the Branch 2 variable

Select Either distribution smaller (Two-Tailed Test) in the Alternative Hypothesis box
Click OK Step 5. When the StatTools dialogue box appears:
Click OK When the Choose Variable Ordering dialogue box appears:
Click OK
If you want to make the assumption that the two populations have the same shape, select Median Version in the Analysis Type box. The test results will be the same, with the output showing the hypotheses are about the difference between the two population medians.
