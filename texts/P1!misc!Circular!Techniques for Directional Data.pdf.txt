MOR DIRECTIONAL DATA

I TRODUCTION
1.1

In recent years techniques have been developed for dealing

with statistical data where the observations are directions, and where
the directione are assumed to be more or less concentrated around a
single mode.

In three dimensions,

the distribution used to describe

such directional data is Fisher' s (1953) distribution, and in two
dimensions it is the von Mises distribution.

In this paper we extend

the techniques for th2se distributions to deal with axial data, i.e.
data consisting of vectors whose direction can be in either sense,

and

also for use with directed data from populations with two modes, in
opposite directions.

The techniques make use of tables already prepared

for the Fisher and von Mises distlributions.
are,

in three dimensioLa,

Examples of directed data

directions of magnetization of roctks,

or, in

two dimensions; directions of bird flights or of prevailing winds;
examples of axial data are normals to planes of cleavage of rocks, or
inclinations of the long axis of pebbles in till deposits.
The procedtLres will be given first for three dimensions, since
later on it is easy to adapt them for two d.rensions; the rest of the
introduction duals with notation to be used.

The Fisher distribution is

described in section 2) its bimodal extension, assuming axial data or
directed data with equal modal strengths, is given in section 3, with

examples; tests of hypotheses for three-dimensional data are in section

4. For two dimensions, the von Mises distribution and its bimodal

extension are treated in

The adaptation of all the procedures for directed data but with

unequal modes in given in section 6. section 7 demonstrates the importance of knowing the type of data, and deals briefly with related topics.

The techniques have begun to be used in applied work,

particularly iV a geological context; see, for example, Andrews and
Shimizu ' 1966),

and, for a wider discussion, with a long list of

references, Watson (1968).

It will be convenient now to sumarize these

procedures; in the next section they will be adapted for use with
axial or bimodal three-dimensional data.

BIMODAL EXTENSION OF THE FISHER DISTRIBUTION

bimodal data is obtained by superimposing two Fisher distributions with

represents the direction of the two modes,

is then

f(e) = 2 sin 0 (a exp(K cos 9)+(l-a)exp(-K cos e))

P has a umiform distribution between

0

and

2n

as before.

The relative strength of the two modes is measured by the parameter
a, which lies between

and

Distribution (3) will be used to describe directed data with unequal
modesi distribution (4) will be used in analyzing axial data, if both
ends are recorded.

In general, the modal axis will not be known, and

must be estimated.

When A

is known, pointing, say, to the North pole,

3
I

we could choose to record axial data by one point only, in the northern
hemisphere; the density of

(5)

f()

e is then

sin K (cosh (K cos e)), 0 < 8 < it12·

In practice, a given experimenter

Ii

say collecting directions of

magnetization of rocks, will probably show a natural preference for
recording the data in one sense more often than the other, so that a
given sample of axial data, as recorded, may look like directed data
with two unequal modes or even only one mode; this can be very deceptive.
It is therefore important to know what type of data is in a given sample
in order to decide the analysis to be undertakeni one should not rely

only on the appearance of the sample.

-

We illustrate this point in

section 7.
We now discuss two estimation problems, for distribution (4); how

--

to estimate the direction of the modal axis A, when this is not known
(so that it does not lie along

e = 0); and how to estimate K. The

techniques to be given will not depend on which end of a diameter is
chosen to represent an observation with no preferred sense; thus for

one end only of each

A knowledgeable ex-

in Sample 1, where at the end we see that

R°

is found with none of the

original vectors, as given, needing to be reversed. Thus straight
Fisher-distribution techniques would have given the same resultant.
But it would have been easy to reverse a selection of the given vectors

to produce an entirely different Fisher resultant.

On the sphere,

Note that in any case,

even

7.2

Alternate distributions.

Another distribution for bimodal

e

or axial data has been proposed by Watson (1966); the density for
20)
(if the modal axis A is along
is

proportional to

e - 0),

I.
|

and

D

exp(X cos

is uniform as before.

Use of this distribution, with

estimation as described in Watson (1966) gives the following modal axis estimates

for Samples I to 4 in Table 1; Sample 1,

6

= 102.6,

= 111.7 ; Sample 3,
Sample 2, 0 = 78.2, 0

e

= 98.2,

o = 148.4 ; Sample

The results are in good agreement with those

4, e = 106.2, 0 = 127.9.
given in Table 1.

.

o = 113.6

Testing procedures are not yet as well developed

for this distribution as for the Fisher distribution.

In two dimensions, the corresponding density is equivalent to a
density proportional to exp(% cos 2e); thus the doubled angles have a
von Mises distribution, and analysis proceeds by doubling the angles

given, estimating the modal vector, and halving its angle.

Direct application of voL Mises techniques rejects the hypothesis,

at

the 5% level, that the samples have a common modal vector; details are

I

in Stephens (1969c).

These results compare well with those in Table 3.

Neither of the above distributions in two or three dimensions, is
strictly applicable to directed data with unequal modes, except that tbh

techniques, to estimate the modal axis,

can still

be employed.

Statistical data in the form of directions may be recorded as twoor three-dimensional unit vectors from an origin 0 to points P on
the circumference of a circle or the surface of a sphere. In recent
years techniques have been developed to deal with such data, when the
vectors are directed, i.e., have a preferred sense. This paper shows
how the techniques may be adopted for use with axial data, i.e., vectors
with no preferred sense, and also for bimodal directed data. Several
practical illustrations are given.
